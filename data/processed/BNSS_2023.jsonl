This is equivalent to a statement that the case was not provided for by\nsub-section (2) of section 122 of the said Sanhita, and that the general exceptions did not\napply to it.\n(c) A is accused of murder, cheating, theft, extortion, or criminal intimidation, or using\na false property-mark. The charge may state that A committed murder, or\ncheating, or theft, or extortion, or criminal intimidation, or that he used a false property-\nmark, without reference to the definitions, of those crimes contained in the Bharatiya Nyaya\nSanhita, 2023; but the sections under which the offence is punishable must, in each instance\nbe referred to in the charge.\n(d) A is charged under section 219 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, with\nintentionally obstructing a sale of property offered for sale by the lawful authority of a\npublic servant.

The Court may infer from this that the omission to set out the\nmanner of the cheating is not material.\n(c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out\nin the charge. There were many transactions between A and B, and A had no means of\nknowing to which of them the charge referred, and offered no defence. The Court may infer\nfrom such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a\nmaterial error.\n(d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st January, 2023. In fact, the\nmurdered person's name was Haidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was\nthe 20th January, 2023. A was never charged with any murder but one, and had heard the\ninquiry before the Magistrate, which referred exclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The\nCourt may infer from these facts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was\nimmaterial.\n(e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 2023, and\nKhoda Baksh (who tried to arrest him for that murder) on the 21st January, 2023. When\ncharged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was tried for the murder of Khoda Baksh. The\nwitnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court\nmay infer from this that A was misled, and that the error was material.\n239. (1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time before judgment is\npronounced.\n(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused.\n(3) If the alteration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding immediately with\nthe trial is not likely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or\nthe prosecutor in the conduct of the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such\nalteration or addition has been made, proceed with the trial as if the altered or added charge\nhad been the original charge.\n(4) If the alteration or addition is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is\nlikely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid,\nthe Court may either direct a new trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary.\n(5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of\nwhich previous sanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such\nsanction is obtained, unless sanction has been already obtained for a prosecution on the\nsame facts as those on which the altered or added charge is founded.\n240. Whenever a charge is altered or added to by the Court after the commencement\nof the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed—\n(a) to recall or re-summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or\naddition, any witness who may have been examined, unless the Court, for reasons to\nbe recorded in writing, considers that the prosecutor or the accused, as the case may\nbe, desires to recall or re-examine such witness for the purpose of vexation or delay or\nfor defeating the ends of justice;\nEffect of\nerrors.\nCourt may\nalter charge.\nRecall of\nwitnesses\nwhen charge\naltered.\n78\nTHE GAZETTE OF INDIA EXTRAORDINARY\n[Part II— \n___________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________________\n79\n(b) also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material.\nB.— Joinder of charges\n241.
