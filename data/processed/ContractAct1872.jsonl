See the Indian Majority Act, 1875 (9 of 1875). \n14 \n \nExplanation.—It is immaterial whether the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) is or is not in force in the \nplace where the coercion is employed. \nIllustration \nA, on board an English ship on the high seas, causes B to enter into an agreement by an act amounting to criminal \nintimidation under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). \nA afterwards sues B for breach of contract at Calcutta. \nA has employed coercion, although his act is not an offence by the law of England, and although section 506 of the Indian \nPenal Code (45 of 1860) was not in force at the time when or place where the act was done. \n1[16.“Undue influence” defined.—(1) A contract is said to be induced by “undue influence” where \nthe relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a position to dominate the \nwill of the other and uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other. \n(2) In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing principle, a person is deemed \nto be in a position to dominate the will of another— \n(a) where he holds a real or apparent authority over the other , or where he stands in a fiduciary \nrelation to the other; or \n(b) where he makes a contract with a person whose mental capacity is temporarily or permanently \naffected by reason of age, illness, or mental or bodily distress. \n(3) Where a person who is in a position to dominate the will of another, enters into a contract with \nhim, and the t ransaction appears, on the face of it or on the evidence adduced, to be unconscionable, the \nburden of proving that such contract was not induced by undue influence shall lie upon the person in a \nposition to dominate the will of the other. \nNothing in this sub-section shall affect the provisions of section 111 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 \n(1 of 1872). \nIllustrations \n(a) A having advanced money to his son, B, during his minority, upon B ’s coming of age obtains, by misuse of parental influence, a bond \nfrom B for a greater amount than the sum due in respect of the advance. A employs undue influence. \n(b) A, a man enfeebled by disease or age, is induced, by B ’s influence over him as his medical attendant, to agree to pay B an unreasonable \nsum for his professional services. B employs undue influence. \n(c) A, being in debt to B, the money-lender of his village, contracts a fresh loan on terms which appear to be unconscionable. It lies on B to \nprove that the contract was not induced by undue influence. \n(d) A applies to a banker for a loan at a time when there is stringency in the money market. The banker declines to make the loan except at \nan unusually high rate of interest. A accepts the loan on these terms. This is a transaction in the ordinary course of business, and the contract is \nnot induced by undue influence.] \n17. “Fraud” defined.—“Fraud” means and includes any of the following acts committed by a party \nto a contract, or with his connivance, or by his agent 2, with intent to deceive another party thereto of his \nagent, or to induce him to enter into the contract:— \n(1) the suggestion, as a fact, of that which is not true, by one who does not believe it to be true; \n(2) the active concealment of a fact by one having knowledge or belief of the fact; \n(3) a promise made without any intention of performing it; \n(4) any other act fitted to deceive; \n(5) any such act or omission as the law specially declares to be fraudulent. \nExplanation.—Mere silence as to facts likely to affect the willingness of a person to enter into a \ncontract is not fraud, unless the circumstances of the case are such that, regard being had to them, it is the \nduty of the person keeping silence to speak3, or unless his silence is, in itself, equivalent to speech. \n \n1. Subs. by Act 6 of 1899, s. 2, for the original s. 16. \n2. Cf. s. 238, infra. \n3. See s. 143, infra. \n15 \n \nIllustrations \n(a) A sells, by auction, to B, a horse which A knows to be unsound. A says nothing to B about the horse ’s unsoundness. \nThis is not fraud in A. \n(b) B is A’s daughter and has just come of age. Here, the relation between the parties would make it A ’s duty to tell B if the \nhorse is unsound. \n(c) B says to A —“If you do not deny it, I shall assume that the horse is sound. ” A says nothing. Here, A ’s silence is \nequivalent to speech. \n(d) A and B, being traders, enter upon a contract. A has private information of a change in prices which would affect B ’s \nwillingness to proceed with the contract. A is not bound to inform B. \n18. “Misrepresentation” defined.—“Misrepresentation” means and includes— \n(1) the positive assertion, in a manner not warranted by the information of the person making it, \nof that which is not true, though he believes it to be true; \n(2) any breach of duty which, without an intent to deceive, gains an advantage to the person \ncommitting it, or any one claiming under him; by misleading another to his pr ejudice, or to the \nprejudice of any one claiming under him; \n(3) causing, however innocently, a party to an agreement , to make a mistake as to the substance \nof the thing which is the subject of the agreement. \n19. Voidability of agreements without free consent.—When consent to an agreement is caused by \ncoercion,1*** fraud or misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party \nwhose consent was so caused. \nA party to a contract whose cons ent was caused by fraud or mis representation, may, if he thinks fit, \ninsist that the contract shall be performed, and that he shall be put in the position in which he would have \nbeen if the representations made had been true. \nException.—If such consent was caused by misrepresentation or by silence, fraudulent within the \nmeaning of section 17, the contract, nevertheless, is not voidable, if the party whose consent was so \ncaused had the means of discovering the truth with ordinary diligence. \nExplanation.—A fraud or misrepresentation which did not cause the consent to a contract of the party \non whom such fraud was practised, or to whom such misrepresentation was made, does not render a \ncontract voidable. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, intending to dece ive B, falsely represents that five hundred maunds of indigo are made annually at A ’s factory, and \nthereby induces B to buy the factory. The contract is voidable at the option of B. \n(b) A, by a misrepresentation, leads B erroneously to believe that, five hundred maunds of indigo are made annually at A ’s \nfactory. B examines the accounts of the factory, which show that only four hundred maunds of indigo have been made. After thi s \nB buys the factory. The contract is not voidable on account of A’s misrepresentation. \n(c) A fraudulently informs B that A’s estate is free from in cumbrance. B thereupon buys the estate. The estate is subject to a \nmortgage. B may either avoid the contract, or may insist on its being carried out and the mortgage debt redeemed. \n(d) B, having discovered a vein of ore on the estate of A, adopts means to conceal, and does conceal, the existence of the ore \nfrom A. Through A’s ignorance B is enabled to buy the estate at an under-value. The contract is voidable at the option of A. \n(e) A is en titled to succeed to an estate at the death of B ; B dies: C, having received intelligence of B ’s death, prevents the \nintelligence reaching A, and thus induces A to sell him his interest in the estate. The sale is voidable at the option of A. \n2[19A. Power to set aside contract induced by undue influence.—When consent to an agreement is \ncaused by undue influence, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the par ty whose consent \nwas so caused. \n \n1. The words “undue influence” rep. by Act 6 of 1899, s. 3. \n2. Ins. by Act 6 of 1899, s. 3. \n16 \n \nAny such contract may be set aside either absolutely or, if the party who was entitled to avoid it has \nreceived any benefit thereunder, upon such terms and conditions as to the Court may seem just. \nIllustrations \n(a) A’s son has forged B’s name to a promissory note. B under threat of prosecuting A’s son, obtains a bond from A for the \namount of the forged note. If B sues on this bond, the Court may set the bond aside. \n(b) A, a money -lender, advances Rs. 100 to B, an agriculturist, and, by undue influence, induces B to execute a bond for \nRs. 200 with interest at 6 per cent. per month. Th e Court may set the bond aside, ordering B to repay the Rs. 100 with s uch \ninterest as may seem just.] \n20.Agreement void where both parties are under mistake as to matter of fact.—Where both the \nparties to an agreement are under a mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agreement \nis void. \nExplanation.—An erroneous opinion as to the value of the thing which forms the subject -matter of \nthe agreement, is not to be deemed a mistake as to a matter of fact. \nIllustrations \n(a) A agrees to sell to B a specific cargo of goods supposed to be on its way from England to Bombay. It turns out that, \nbefore the day of the bargain, the ship conveying the cargo had been cast away and the goods lost. Neither party wa s aware of the \nthese facts. The agreement is void. \n(b) A agrees to buy from B a certain horse. It turns out that the ho rse was dead at the time of the bargain, though neither \nparty was aware of the fact. The agreement is void. \n(c) A, being entitled to an estate for the life of B, agrees to sell it to C. B was dead at the time of the agreement, but both \nparties were ignorant of the fact. The agreement is void. \n21. Effect of mistakes as to law.—A contract is not voidable because it was caused by a mist ake as \nto any law in force in 1[India]; but a mistak e as to a law not in force in 1[India] has the sa me effect as a \nmistake of fact. \n2* * * * * \nIllustration \nA and B make a contract grounded on the erroneous belief that a particular debt is barred by the Indian Law of Limitation : \nthe contract is not voidable. \n3* * * * * \n22. Contract caused by mistake of one party as to matter of fact.—A contract is not voidable \nmerely because it was caused by one of the parties to it being under a mistake as to a matter of fact. \n23. What considerations and objects are lawful, and what not.—The consideration or object of an \nagreement is lawful, unless— \nit is forbidden by law4; or \nis of such a nature that if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of any law; or \nis fraudulent ; or \ninvolves or implies injury to the person or property of another; or \nthe Court regards it as immoral, or opposed to public policy. \n \n1. The original words ‘British India” have successively been amended by the A.O. 1948 and the A.O. 1950 to read as above. \n2. Paragraph 2, ins. by the A.O. 1937, and as amended by the A. O. 1948 was Rep. by the A. O. 1950. \n3. The second Illustration to s. 21 rep. by Act 24 of 1917, s. 3 and the Second Schedule. \n4. See ss. 26, 27, 28 and 30, infra. \n17 \n \nIn each of these cases, the consideration or object of an agreement is said to be unlawful. Every \nagreement of which the object or consideration is unlawful is void. \nIllustrations \n(a) A agrees to sell his house to B for 10,000 rupees. Here B ’s promise to pay the sum of 10,000 rupees is the consideration \nfor A’s promise to sell the house, and A’s promise to sell the house is the consideration for B ’s promise to pay the 10,000 rupees. \nThese are lawful considerations. \n(b) A promises to pay B 1,000 rupe es at the end of six months, if C, who owes that sum to B, fails to pay it. B promises to \ngrant time to C accordingly. Here, the promise of each party is the consideration for the promise of the other party , and they are \nlawful considerations. \n(c) A promises, for a certain sum paid to him by B, to make good to B the value of his ship if it is wrecked on a certain \nvoyage. Here, A’s promise is the consideration for B ’s payment and B’s payment is the consideration for A ’s promise and t hese \nare lawful considerations. \n(d) A promises to maintain B ’s child, and B promises to pay A 1,000 rupees yearly for the purpose. Here , the promise of \neach party is the consideration for the promise of the other party. They are lawful considerations. \n(e) A, B and C enter in to an agreement for the division am ong them of gains acquired or to be acquired, by them by fraud. \nThe agreement is void, as its object is unlawful. \n(f) A promises to obtain for B an employment in the public service and B promises to pay 1,000 rupees to A. The agreement \nis void, as the consideration for it is unlawful. \n(g) A, being agent for a landed proprietor, agrees for money, without the knowledge of his principal, to obtain for B a lease \nof land belonging to his principal. The agreement between A and B is void, as it implies a fraud by conce alment, by A, on his \nprincipal. \n(h) A promises B to drop a prosecution which he has instituted against B for robbery, and B promises to restore the value of \nthe things taken. The agreement is void, as its object is unlawful. \n(i) A’s estate is sold for arrears of revenue under the provisions of an Act of the Legislature, by which the defaulter is \nprohibited from purchasing the estate. B, upon an understanding with A, becomes the purchaser, and agrees to convey the estate \nto A upon receiving from him the price which B has paid. The agreement is void, as it renders the transaction, in effect , a \npurchase by the defaulter, and would so defeat the object of the law. \n(j) A, who is B ’s mukhtar, promises to exercise his in fluence, as such, with B in favour of C, and C promises to pay 1,000 \nrupees to A. The agreement is void, because it is immoral. \n(k) A agrees to let her daughter to hire to B for concubinage. The agreement is void, because it is immoral, though the letting \nmay not be punishable under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860). \nVoid agreements \n24.Agreements void, if consideration s and objects unlawful in part .—If any part of a single \nconsideration for one or more objects, or any one or any part of any one of several considerations for a \nsingle object, is unlawful, the agreement is void. \nIllustration \nA promises to superintend, on behalf of B, a legal manufacture of indigo, and an illegal traffic in other articles. B promises \nto pay to A a salary of 10,000 rupees a yea r. The agreement is void, the object of A ’s promise, and the consideration for B ’s \npromise, being in part unlawful. \n25. Agreement without consideration, void, unless i t is in writing and registered ,or is a promise \nto compensate for something done or is a promise to pay a debt barred by li mitation law .—An \nagreement made without consideration is void, unless— \n(1) it is expressed in writing and registered under the law for the time being in force for the \nregistration of 1[documents], and is made on account of natural love and affection between parties \nstanding in a near relation to each other ; or unless \n(2) it is a promise to compensate, wholly or in part, a person who has already voluntarily done \nsomething for the promisor, or something which the promiso r wa s legally compellable to do; or \nunless; \n \n1. Subs. by Act 12 of 1891, s. 2 and the Second Schedule, Pt. I, for “assurances”. \n18 \n \n(3) it is a promise, made in writing and signed by the person to be charged therewith, or by his \nagent generally or specially authorized in that behalf, to pay wholly or in part a debt of which the \ncreditor might have enforced payment but for the law for the limitation of suits. \nIn any of these cases, such an agreement is a contract. \nExplanation 1.—Nothing in this section shall affect the validity, as between the donor and do nee, of \nany gift actually made. \nExplanation 2.—An agreement to which the consent of the promisor is freely given is not void \nmerely because the consideration is inadequate; but the inadequacy of the consideration may be taken into \naccount by the Court in determining the question whether the consent of the promisor was freely given. \nIllustrations \n(a) A promises, for no consideration, to give to B Rs. 1,000. This is a void agreement. \n(b) A, for natural love and affection, promises to give his son, B, Rs. 1,000. A puts his promise to B into writing and registers it. This is a \ncontract. \n(c) A finds B’s purse and gives it to him. B promises to give A Rs. 50. This is a contract. \n(d) A supports B’s infant son. B promises to pay A’s expenses in so doing. This is a contract. \n(e) A owes B Rs. 1,000, but the de bt is barred by the Limitation Act. A signs a written promise to pay B Rs. 500 on account o f the debt. \nThis is a contract. \n(f) A agrees to sell a horse worth Rs. 1,000 for Rs. 10. A ’s consent to the agreement was freely given. The agreement is a contract \nnotwithstanding the inadequacy of the consideration. \n(g) A agrees to sell a horse worth Rs. 1,000 for Rs. 10. A denies that his consent to the agreement was freely given. \nThe inadequacy of the consideration is a fact which the Court should take into account in considering whether or not A’s consent was freely \ngiven. \n26. Agreement in restraint of marriage, void.—Every agreement in restraint of the marriage of any \nperson, other than a minor, is void. \n27. Agreement in restraint of trade, void.—Every agreement by which any one is restrained from \nexercising a lawful profession, trade or business of any kind, is to that extent void. \nException 1.—Saving of agreement not to carry on business of which good -will is sold .—One \nwho sells the good -will of a business may agree with the buyer to refrain from carrying on a similar \nbusiness, within specified local limits, so long as the buyer, or any person deriving title to the good -will \nfrom him, carries on a like business therein, provided that such limits appear to the Court reasonable, \nregard being had to the nature of the business. \n1* * * * *. \n28.Agreements in restraint of legal proceedings, void.—2[Every agreement,— \n(a) by which any party thereto is restricted absolutely from enforcing his rights under or in \nrespect of any contract, by the usual legal proceedings in the ordinary tribunals, or which limits the \ntime within which he may thus enforce his rights; or \n(b) which extinguishes the rights of any party thereto, or discharges any party t hereto, from any \nliability, under or in respect of any contract on the expiry of a specified period so as to restrict any \nparty from enforcing his rights, \nis void to the extent.] \nException 1.—Saving of contract to refer to arbit ration dispute that may arise.—This section \nshall not render illegal a contract, by which two or more persons agree that any dispute which may arise \nbetween them in respect of any subject or class of subjects shall be referred to arbitration, and that only \nthe amount awarded in such arbitration shall be recoverable in respect of the dispute so referred. \n3***** \nException 2.—Saving of contract to refer questions that have already arisen .—Nor shall this \nsection render illegal any contract in writing, by which two or more persons agre e to refer to arbitration \nany question between them which has already arisen, or affect any provision of any law in force for the \ntime being as to references to arbitration4. \n \n1. Exceptions 2 and 3 rep. by Act 9 of 1932, s. 73 and the Second Schedule. \n2. Subs. by Act 1 of 1997, s. 2, for certain words (w.e.f. 8-1-1997). \n3. The second clause of Exception 1 to section 28 rep. by Act 1 of 1877, s. 2 and Sch. \n4. Cf. the Arbitration Act, 1940 (10 of 1940) and the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956), s. 389. \n19 \n \n1[Exception 3.—Saving of a guarantee agreement of a bank or a financial institution.—This \nsection shall not render illegal a contract in writing by which any bank or financial institution stipulate a \nterm in a guarantee or any agreement making a provision for guarantee for extinguishment of the rights or \ndischarge of any party thereto from any liability under or in respect of such guarantee or agreement on the \nexpiry of a specified period which is not less than one year from the date of occurring or non-occurring of \na specified event for extinguishment or discharge of such party from the said liability. \nExplanation.—(i) In Exception 3, the expression “bank” means— \n(a) a “banking company ” as defined in clause ( c) of section 5 of the Banking Regulation \nAct, 1949(10 of 1949); \n(b) “a corresponding new bank” as defined in clause ( da) of section 5 of the Banking Regulation \nAct, 1949(10 of 1949); \n(c) “State Bank of India ” constituted under section 3 of the State Bank of India Act, 1955 \n(23 of 1955); \n(d) “a subsidiary bank” as defined in clause (k) of section 2 of the State Bank of India (Subsidiary \nBanks) Act, 1959(38 of 1959); \n(e) “a Regional Rural Bank ” established under section 3 of the Regional Rural Banks \nAct, 1976(21 of 1976); \n(f) “a Co -operative Bank ” as defined in clause ( cci) of section 5 of the Banking Regulation \nAct, 1949(10 of 1949); \n(g) “a multi -State co -operative bank” as defined in clause ( cciiia) of section 5 of the Banking \nRegulation Act, 1949(10 of 1949); and \n(ii) In Exception 3, the expression “a financial institution ” means any public financial institution \nwithin the meaning of section 4A of the Companies Act, 1956(1 of 1956).] \n29. Agreements void for uncertainty.—Agreements, the meaning of which is not certain, or capable \nof being made certain, are void. \nIllustrations \n(a) A agrees to sell to B “a hundred tons of oil”. There is nothing whatever to show what kind of oil was intended. The \nagreement is void for uncertainty. \n(b) A agrees to sell to B one hundred tons of oil of a specified description, known as an article of commerce. There is no \nuncertainty here to make the agreement void. \n(c) A, who is a dealer in cocoanut -oil only, agrees to sell to B “one hundred tons of oil”. The nature of A’s trade affords an \nindication of the meaning of the words, and A has entered into a contract for the sale of one hundred tons of cocoanut-oil. \n(d) A agrees to sell to B “all the grain in my granary at Ramnagar”. There is no uncertainty here to make the agreement void. \n(e) A agrees to sell B “one thousand maunds of rice at a price to be fixed by C ”. As the price is capable of being made \ncertain, there is no uncertainty here to make the agreement void. \n(f) A agrees to sell to B “my white horse for rupees five hundred or rupees one thousand”. There is nothing to show which of \nthe two prices was to be given. The agreement is void. \n30. Agreements by way of wager void.—Agreements by way of wager are void; and no suit shall be \nbrought for recovering anything alleged to be won on any wager, or entrusted to any person to abide the \nresult of any game or other uncertain event on which any wager is made. \n \n1.

{"text": "Section 294A of the Indian Penal Code not affected .—Nothing in this section shall be deemed to \nlegalize any transaction connected with horse -racing, to which the provisions of section 294A of the \nIndian Penal Code (45 of 1860) apply. \nCHAPTER III \nOF CONTINGENT CONTRACTS \n31. “Contingent contract ” defined.—A “contingent contract is a contract to do or not to do \nsomething, if some event, collateral to such contract, does or does not happen. \nIllustration \nA contracts to pay B Rs. 10,000 if B’s house is burnt. This is a contingent contract. \n32. Enforcement of contracts con tingent on an event happening .—Contingent contracts to do or \nnot to do anything if an uncertain future event happens cannot be enforced by law unless and until that \nevent has happened. \nIf the event becomes impossible, such contracts become void. \nIllustrations \n(a) A makes a contract with B to buy B ’s horse if A survives C. This contract cannot be enforced by law unless and until C \ndies in A’s lifetime. \n(b) A makes a contract with B to sell a horse to B at a specified price, if C, to whom the horse has been offered, refuses to \nbuy him. The contract cannot be enforced by law unless and until C refuses to buy the horse. \n(c) A contracts to pay B a sum of money when B marries C. C dies without being married to B. The contract becomes void. \n33. Enforcement of contracts contingent on an event not happening.—Contingent contracts to do \nor not to do anything if an uncertain future event does not happen can be enforced when the happening of \nthat event becomes impossible, and not before. \nIllustration \nA agrees to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship does not return. The ship is sunk. The contract can b e enforced when the \nship sinks. \n34.When event on which contract is contingent to be deemed impossible, if it is the future \nconduct of a living person .—If the future event on which a contract is contingent is the way in which a \nperson will act at an u nspecified time, the event shall be considered to become impossible when such \nperson does anything which renders it impossible that he should so act within any definite time, or \notherwise than under further contingencies. \nIllustration \nA agrees to pay B a sum of money if B marries C. C marries D. The marriage of B to C must now be considered impossible, \nalthough it is possible that D may die and that C may afterwards marry B. \n35.When contracts become void which are contingent on hap pening of spe cified event within \nfixed time .—Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything if a specified uncertain event happens \nwithin a fixed time become void if, at the expiration of the time fixed, such event has not happened, or if, \nbefore the time fixed, such event becomes impossible. \n21 \n \nWhen contracts may be enforced, which are contingent on specified event not happening within \nfixed time.—Contingent contracts to do or not to do anything , if a specified uncertain event does not \nhappen within a fi xed time may be enforced by law when the time fixed has expired and such event has \nnot happened or, before the time fixed has expired, if it becomes certain that such event will not happen. \nIllustrations \n(a) A promises to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship returns within a year. The contract may be enforced if the ship \nreturns within the year, and becomes void if the ship is burnt within the year. \n(b) A promises to pay B a sum of money if a certain ship does not return within a year. The contract may be enforced if the \nship does not return within the year, or is burnt within the year. \n36. Agreement contingent on impossible events void .—Contingent agreements to do or not to do \nanything, if an impossible event happens, are void, whether the impossibility of the event is known or not \nto the parties to the agreement at the time when it is made. \nIllustrations \n(a) A agrees to pay B 1,000 rupees if two straight lines should enclose a space. The agreement is void. \n(b) A agrees to pay B 1,000 rupees if B will marry A ’s daughter C. C was dead at the time of the agreement. The agre ement \nis void. \nCHAPTER IV \nOF THE PERFORMANCE OF CONTRACTS \nContracts which must be performed \n37. Obligation of parties to contracts .—The parties to a contract must either perform, or offer to \nperform, their respective promises, unless such performance is dispensed with or excused under the \nprovisions of this Act, or of any other law. \nPromises bind the representatives of the promisors in case of the death of such promisors before \nperformance, unless a contrary intention appears from the contract. \nIllustrations \n(a) A promises to deliver goods to B on a certain day on payment of Rs. 1,000. A dies before that day. A ’s representatives \nare bound to deliver the goods to B, and B is bound to pay the Rs. 1,000 to A’s representatives. \n(b) A promises to paint a picture for B by a certain day, at a certain price. A dies before the day. The contract cannot be \nenforced either by A’s representatives or by B. \n38. Effect of refusal to accept offer of performance .—Where a promisor has made an offer of \nperformance to the promisee, and the offer has not been accepted, the promisor is not responsible for \nnon-performance, nor does he thereby lose his rights under the contract. \nEvery such offer must fulfil the following conditions:— \n(1) it must be unconditional; \n(2) it must be made at a proper time and place, and under such circumstances that the person to \nwhom it is made may have a reasonable opportunity of ascertaining that the person by whom it is made is \nable and willing there and then to do the whole of what he is bound by his promise to do; \n(3) if the offer is an offer to deliver anything to the promisee, the promisee must have a \nreasonable opportunity of seeing that the thing offered is the thing which the promisor is bound by his \npromise to deliver. \nAn offer to one of several joint promisees has the same legal consequences as an offer to all of them. \n \n22 \n \nIllustration \nA contracts to deliver to B at his warehouse, on the 1st March, 1873, 100 bales of cotton of a particular quality. In order to \nmake an offer of a performance with the effect stated in this section, A must bring the cotton to B ’s warehouse, on the appointed \nday, under such circumstan ces that B may have areasonable opportunity of satisfying himself that the thing offered is cotton of \nthe quality contracted for, and that there are 100 bales. \n39. Effect of refusal of party to p erform promise wholly.—When a party to a contract has refused \nto perform, or disabled himself from performing, his promise in its entirety, the promisee may put an end \nto the contract, unless he has signified, by words or conduct, his acquiescence in its continuance. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, a singer, enters into a contract with B, the manager of a theatre, to sing at his theatre two nights in every week during \nthe next two months, and B engages to pay her 100 rupees for each night ’s performance. On the sixth night A wilfully absents \nherself from the theatre. B is at liberty to put an end to the contract. \n(b) A, a singer, enters into a contract with B, the manager of a theatre, to sing at h is theatre two night’s in every week during \nthe next two months, and B engages to pay her at the rate of 100 rupees for each night. On the sixth night, A wilfully absents \nherself. With the assent of B, A sings on the seventh night. B has signified his acquiescence in the continuance of the contr act, \nand cannot now put an end to it, but is entitled to compensation for the d amage sustained by him through A ’s failure to sing on \nthe sixth night. \nBy whom contracts must be performed \n40.Person by w hom promise is to be performed .—If it appears from the nature of the case that it \nwas the intention of the parties to any contract that any promise contained in it should be performed by \nthe promisor himself, such promise must be performed by the promisor. In other cases, the promisor or \nhis representatives may employ a competent person to perform it. \nIllustrations \n(a) A promises to pay B a sum of money. A may perform this promise, either by personally paying the money to B or by \ncausing it to be paid to B by another ; and, if A dies before the time appointed for payment, his representatives must perform the \npromise, or employ some proper person to do so. \n(b) A promises to paint a picture for B. A must perform this promise personally. \n41. Effect of accepting performance from third pers on.—When a promisee accepts performance \nof the promise from a third person, he cannot afterwards enforce it against the promisor. \n42. Devolution of joint liabilities .—When two or more persons have made a joint promise, then, \nunless a contrary intention appears by the contract, all such persons, during their joint lives, and, after the \ndeath of any of them, his representative jointly with the survivor or survivors, and, after the death of the \nlast survivor, the representatives of all jointly, must fulfil the promise. \n43.Any one of joint promisors may be compelled to perform.—When two or more persons make a \njoint promise, the promisee may, in the absence of express agreement to the contrary, compel any 1[one or \nmore] of such joint promisors to perform the whole of the promise. \nEach promisor may compel contribution.—Each of two or more joint promisors may compel every \nother joint promisor to contribute equally with himself to the performance of the promise, unless a \ncontrary intention appears from the contract. \nSharing of l oss by default in contribution .—If any one of two or more joint promisors makes \ndefault in such contribution, the remaining joint promisors must bear the loss arising from such def ault in \nequal shares. \n \n1. Subs. by Act 12 of 1891, s. 2 and the Second Schedule, Pt. I, for “one”. \n23 \n \nExplanation.—Nothing in this section shall prevent a surety from recovering from his principal, \npayments made by the surety on behalf of the principal, or entitle the principal to recover anything from \nthe surety on account of payments made by the principal. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, B and C jointly promise to pay D 3,000 rupees. D may compel either A or B or C to pay him 3,000 rupees. \n(b) A, B and C jointly promise to pay D the sum of 3,000 rupees. C is compelled to pay the whole. A is insolvent, but his \nassets are sufficient to pay one-half of his debts. C is entitled to receive 500 rupees from A’s estate, and 1,250 rupees from B. \n(c) A, B and C are under a joint promise to pay D 3,000 rupees. C is unable to pay anything, and A is compelled to pay the \nwhole. A is entitled to receive 1,500 rupees from B. \n(d) A, B and C are under a joint promise to pay D 3,000 rupees, A and B being only sureties for C. C fails to pay. A and B \nare compelled to pay the whole sum. They are entitled to recover it from C. \n44.Effect of release of one joint promisor.—Where two or more persons have made a joint promise, \na release of one of such joint promisors by the promisee does not discharge the other join t promisor or \njoint promisors; neither does it free the joint promisors so released from responsibility to the other jo int \npromisor or joint promisors.1 \n45. Devolution of joint rights.—When a person has made a promise to two or more persons jointly, \nthen, unless a contrary intention appears from the contract, the right to claim performance res ts, as \nbetween him and them, with them during their joint lives, and, after the death of any of them, with the \nrepresentative of such deceased person j ointly with the survivor or survivors, and, after the death of the \nlast survivor, with the representatives of all jointly.2 \nIllustration \nA, in consideration of 5,000 rupees, lent to him by B and C, promises B and C jointly to repay them that sum with interest \non a day specified. B dies. The right to claim performance rests with B ’s representative jointly with C during C’s life, and after \nthe death of C with the representatives of B and C jointly. \nTime and place for performance \n46. Time for performance of promise, when no application is to be made and no time is \nspecified.—Where, by the contract, a promisor is to perform his promise without application by the \npromisee, and no time for performance is specified, the engagement must be perf ormed within a \nreasonable time. \nExplanation.—The question “what is a reasonable time” is, in each particular case, a question of fact. \n47.Time and place for performance of promise, where time is specified and no application to be \nmade.—When a promise is to be performed on a certain day, and the promisor has undertaken to perform \nit without application by the promisee, the promiso r may perform it at any time during the usual hours of \nbusiness on such day and at the place at which the promise ought to be performed. \nIllustration \nA promises to deliver goods at B ’s warehouse on the first January. On that day A brings the goods to B ’s warehouse, but \nafter the usual hour for closing it, and they are not received. A has not performed his promise. \n48. Application for performance on certain day to be at proper time and place .—When a \npromise is to be performed on a certain day, and the pr omisor has not undertaken to perform it without \napplication by the promisee, it is the duty of the promisee to apply for performance at a proper place and \nwithin the usual hours of business. \n \n1. See s. 138, infra. \n2. For an Exception to s. 45 in case of Government securities, see the Public Debt Act, 1944 (18 of 1944), s. 8. \n24 \n \nExplanation.—The question “what is a proper time and place ” is, in each particular case, a question \nof fact. \n49. Place for performance of promise, where no application to be made and no place fixed for \nperformance.—When a promise is to be performed without application by the promisee, and no place is \nfixed for the performance of it, it is the duty of the promisor to apply to the promisee to appoint a \nreasonable place for the performance of the promise, and to perform it at such place. \nIllustration \nA undertakes to deliver a thousand maunds of jute to B on a fixed day . A must apply to B to appoint a reasonable place for \nthe purpose of receiving it, and must deliver it to him at such place. \n50. Performance in manner or at time prescr ibed or sanctioned by promisee.—The performance \nof any promise may be made in any manner, or at any time which the promisee prescribes or sanctions. \nIllustrations \n(a) B owes A 2,000 rupees. A desires B to pay the amount to A ’s account with C, a banker. B, who also banks with C, \norders the amount to be transferred from his account to A ’s credit, and this is done by C. Afterwards, and before A knows of the \ntransfer, C fails. There has been a good payment by B. \n(b) A and B are mutually indebted. A and B settle an account by setting off one item against another, and B pays A the \nbalance found to be due from him upon such settlement. This amounts to a payment by A and B, respectively, of the sums which \nthey owed to each other. \n(c) A owes B 2,000 rupees. B accepts some of A ’s goods in reduction of the debt. The delivery of go ods operates as a pa rt \npayment. \n(d) A desires B, who owes him Rs. 100, to send him a note for Rs. 100 by post. The debt is discharged as soon as B puts into \nthe post a letter containing the note duly addressed to A. \nPerformance of reciprocal promises \n51.Promisor not bound to perform, unless reciprocal promise e ready and willing to \nperform.—When a contract consists of reciprocal promises to be simultaneously performed, no promisor \nneed perform his promise unless the promisee is ready and willing to perform his reciprocal promise. \nIllustrations \n(a) A and B contract that A shall deliver goods to B to be paid for by B on delivery. \nA need not deliver the goods, unless B is ready and willing to pay for the goods on delivery. \nB need not pay for the goods, unless A is ready and willing to deliver them on payment. \n(b) A and B contract that A shall deliver goods to B at a price to be paid by instalments, the first ins talment to be paid on \ndelivery. \nA need not deliver, unless B is ready and willing to pay the first instalment on delivery. \nB need not pay the first instalment, unless A is ready and willing to deliver the goods on payment of the first instalment. \n52.Order of performance of reciprocal promises .—Where the order in which reciprocal promises \nare to be performed is expressly fixed by the contract, they shall be performed in that order; and where the \norder is not expressly fixed by the contract, they shall be performed in that order which the natu re of the \ntransaction requires. \nIllustrations \n(a) A and B contract that A shall build a house for B at a fixed price. A ’s promise to build the house m ust be performed \nbefore B’s promise to pay for it. \n(b) A and B contract that A shall make over his stock -in-trade to B at a fixed price, and B promises to give security for the \npayment of the money. A ’s promise need not be performed until the security is given, for the nature of the transaction requires \nthat A should have security before he delivers up his stock. \n25 \n \n53. Liability of party preventing event on which the contract is to take effect.—When a contract \ncontains reciprocal promises, and one party to the contract prevents the other from performing his \npromise, the contract becomes voidable at the option of the party so prevented; and he is e ntitled to \ncompensation 1from the other party for any loss which he may sustain in consequence of the n on-\nperformance of the contract. \nIllustration \nA and B contract that B shall execute certain work for A for a thousand rupees. B is ready and willing to execute the work \naccordingly, but A preven ts him from doing so. The contract is voidable at the option of B ; and, if he elects to rescind it, he is \nentitled to recover from A compensation for any loss which he has incurred by its non-performance. \n54. Effect of default as to that promise which should be first performed, in contract con sisting \nof reciprocal promises.—When a contract consists of reciprocal promises, such that one of them cannot \nbe performed, or that its performance cannot be claimed till the other has been performed, and the \npromisor of the promise last mentioned fails to perform it, such promisor cannot claim the performance of \nthe reciprocal promise, and must make compensation to the other party to the contract for any loss which \nsuch other party may sustain by the non-performance of the contract. \nIllustrations \n(a) A hires B’s ship to take in and convey, from Calcutta to the Mauritius, a cargo to be provided by A, B receiving a certain \nfreight for its conveyance. A does not provide any cargo for the ship. A cannot claim the performance of B’s promise, and must \nmake compensation to B for the loss which B sustains by the non-performance of the contract. \n(b) A contracts with B to execute certain builder ’s work for a fixed price, B supplying the scaffolding and timber necessary \nfor the work. B refuses to furnish any scaffolding or timber, and the work cannot be executed. A need not execute the work, an d \nB is bound to make compensation to A for any loss caused to him by the non-performance of the contract. \n(c) A contracts with B to deliver to him, at a specified price, certain merchandise on board a ship which cannot arrive for a \nmonth, and B engages to pay for the merchandise within a week from the date of the contract. B does not pay within the week. \nA’s promise to deliver need not be performed, and B must make compensation. \n(d) A promises B to sell him one hundred bales of merchandise, to be delivered next day, and B promises A to pay for them \nwithin a month. A does not deliver according to his promise. B ’s promise to pay need not be performed , and A must make \ncompensation. \n55. Effect of failure to perform at fixed time, in contr act in which time is essential .—When a \nparty to a contract promises to do a certain thing at or before a specified time, or certain things at or \nbefore specified times, and fails to do any such thing at or before the specified time, the contract, or so \nmuch of it as has not been performe d, becomes voidable at the option of the promisee, if the intention of \nthe parties was that time should be of the essence of the contract. \nEffect of such failure when time is not essential.—If it was not the intention of the parties that time \nshould be of the essence of the contract, the contract does not become voidable by the failure to do such \nthing at or before the specified time ; but the promisee is entitled to compensation from the promisor for \nany loss occasioned to him by such failure. \nEffect of acceptance of performance at ti me other than that agreed upon .—If, in case of a \ncontract voidable on account of the promisor ’s failure to perform his promise at the time agreed, the \npromisee accepts performance of such promise at any time other than that a greed, the promisee cannot \nclaim compensation for any loss occasioned by the non -performance of the promise at the time agreed, \nunless, at the time of such acceptance, he gives notice to the promisor of his intention to do so.2 \nSTATE AMENDMENT \nUttar Pradesh \nAmendment of section 55.—In section 55 of the Principal Act, in the third paragraph, for the words \n“unless at the time of such acceptance he gives notice to the promiser of his intention to do so”, the words \n“where at the time of such acceptance he has waived his right to do so” shall be substituted.” \n[Vide Uttar Pradesh 57 of 1976, s. 26] \n \n1. See s. 73, infra. \n2. C.f. ss. 62 and 63, infra. \n26 \n \n56. Agreement to do impossible act.—An agreement to do an act impossible in itself is void. \nContract to do an act afterwards be coming impossible or unlawful .—A contract to do an act \nwhich, after the contract is made, becomes impossible, or, by reason of some event which the promisor \ncould not prevent, unlawful, becomes void when the act becomes impossible or unlawful.1 \nCompensation for loss through non -performance of act known to be impossible or unlawful .—\nWhere one person has promised to do something which he knew, or, with reasonable diligence, might \nhave known, and which the promisee did not know, to be impossible or unlawful, such promisor must \nmake compensa tion to such promisee for any loss which such promisee sustains through the non-\nperformance of the promise. \nIllustrations \n(a) A agrees with B to discover treasure by magic. The agreement is void. \n(b) A and B contract to marry each other. Before the time fixed for the marriage, A goes mad. The contract becomes void. \n(c) A contracts to marry B, being already married to C, and being forbidden by the law to which he is subject to p ractise \npolygamy, A must make compensation to B for the loss caused to her by the non-performance of his promise. \n(d) A contracts to take in cargo for B at a foreign port. A’s Government afterwards declares war against the country in which \nthe port is situated. The contract becomes void when war is declared. \n(e) A contracts to act at a theatre for six months in consideration of a sum paid in advance by B. On several occasions A is \ntoo ill to act. The contract to act on those occasions becomes void. \n57.Reciprocal promise to do things legal, and also other things illegal .—Where persons \nreciprocally promise, firstly, to do certain things which are legal, and, secondly, under specified \ncircumstances, to do certain other things which are illegal, the first set of promises is a contract, but the \nsecond is a void agreement. \nIllustration \nA and B agree that A shall sell B a house for 10,000 rupees, but that, if B uses it as a gambling house, he sh all pay A 50,000 \nrupees for it. \nThe first set of reciprocal promises, namely, to sell the house and to pay 10,000 rupees for it, is a contract. \nThe second set is for an unlawful object, namely, that B may use the house as a gambling house, and is a void agreement. \n58. Alternative pro mise, one branch being illegal .—In the case of an alternative promise, one \nbranch of which is legal and the other illegal, the legal branch alone can be enforced. \nIllustration \nA and B agree that A shall pay B 1,000 rupees, for which B shall afterwards deliver to A either rice or smuggled opium. \nThis is a valid contract to deliver rice, and a void agreement as to the opium. \nAppropriation of payments \n59.Application of payment where debt to be discharged is indicated .—Where a debtor, owing \nseveral distinct debts to one person, makes a payment to him, either with express intimation, or under \ncircumstances implying, that the payment is to be applied to the discharge of some particular debt, the \npayment, if accepted, must be applied accordingly. \n \n \n1. See s. 65, infra. \n27 \n \nIllustrations \n(a) A owes B, among other debts, 1,000 rupees upon a promissory note which falls due on the first June. He owes B no other debt of that \namount. On the first June, A pays to B 1,000 rupees. The payment is to be applied to the discharge of the promissory note. \n(b) A owes to B, among other debts, the sum of 567 rupees. B writes to A and demands payment of this sum. A sends to B 567 rupees. This \npayment is to be applied to the discharge of the debt of which B had demanded payment. \n60. Application of payment where debt to be discharged is not indicated.—Where the debtor has \nomitted to intimate and th ere are no other circumstances indicating to which debt the payment is to be \napplied, the creditor may apply it at his discretion to any lawful debt actually due and payable to him from \nthe debtor, whether its recovery is or is not barred by the law in force for the time being a s to the \nlimitation of suits. \n61. Application of payment whe re neither party appropriates .—Where neither party makes any \nappropriation, the payment shall be applied in discharge of the debts in order of time, whether they are or \nare not barred by the law in force for the time being as to the limitation of suits. If the debts are of equal \nstanding, the payment shall be applied in discharge of each proportionably. \nContracts which need not be performed \n62. Effect of novation, rescissio n, and alteration of contract .—If the parties to a contract agree to \nsubstitute a new contract for it, or to rescind or alter it, the original contract, need not be performed. \nIllustrations \n(a) A owes money to B under a contract. It is agreed between A, B and C that B shall thenceforth accept C as his debtor, instea d of A. The \nold debt of A to B is at an end, and a new debt from C to B has been contracted. \n(b) A owes B 10,000 rupees. A enters into an arrangement with B and gives B a mortgage of his (A’s) estate for 5,000 rupees in place of the \ndebt of 10,000 rupees. This is a new contract and extinguishes the old. \n(c) A owes B 1,000 rupe es under a contract. B owes C 1,000 rupees B orders A to credit C with 1,000 rupees in his books, but C does not \nassent to the arrangement. B still owes C 1,000 rupees, and no new contract has been entered into. \n63. Promisee may dispense with or remit performance of promise e.—Every promisee may \ndispense with or remit, wholly or in part, the performance of the promisee made to him, or may extend the \ntime for such performance1,or may accept instead of it any satisfaction which he thinks fit. \nIllustrations \n(a) A promises to paint a picture for B. B afterwards forbids him to do so. A is no longer bound to perform the promise. \n(b) A owes B 5,000 rupees. A pays to B, and B accepts, in satisfaction of the whole debt, 2,000 rupees paid at the time a nd place at which \nthe 5,000 rupees were payable. The whole debt is discharged. \n(c) A owes B 5,000 rupees. C pays to B 1,000 rupees, and B accepts them, in satisfaction of his claim on A. This payment is a d ischarge of \nthe whole claim2. \n(d) A owes B, under. a contract, a sum of money, the amount of which has not been ascertained. A , without ascertaining the amount, gives \nto B, and B, in satisfaction thereof, accepts, the sum of 2,000 rupees. This is a discharge of the whole debt, whatever may be its amount. \n(e) A owes B 2,000 rupees, and is also indebted to other creditors. A makes an arrangement with his creditor s, including B, to pay them a \n3[composition] of eight annas in the rupee upon their respective demands. Payment to B of 1,000 rupees is a discharge of B’s demand. \n64. Consequences of rescission of voidable contract.—When a person at whose option a contract is \nvoidable rescinds it, the other party thereto need not perform any promise therein contained in which he is \npromisor. The party rescinding a voidable contract shall, if he have received any benefit thereunder from \nanother party to such contract, restore such benefit, so far as may be, to the person from whom it was \nreceived.4 \n \n1. But see s. 135, infra. \n2. See s. 41, supra. \n3. Subs. by Act 12 of 1891, s. 2 and the Second Schedule, Pt. I, for “compensation”. \n4. See s. 75, infra. \n28 \n \n65. Obligation of person who has received advantage under void agreem ent, or contract that \nbecomes void .—When an agreement is discovered to be void, or when a contract becomes void, any \nperson who has received any advantage under such agreement or contract is bound to restore it, or to \nmake compensation for it to the person from whom he received it. \nIllustrations \n(a) A pays B 1,000 rupees in consideration of B’s promising to marry C, A’s daughter. C is dead at the time of the promise. \nThe agreement is void, but B must repay A the 1,000 rupees. \n(b) A contracts with B to deliver to him 250 maunds of rice before the first of May. A delivers 130 maunds only before that \nday, and none after. B retains the 130 maunds after the first of May. He is bound to pay A for them. \n(c) A, a singer, contracts with B, the manager of a theatre, to sing at his theatre for two nights in every week during the next \ntwo months, and B engages to pay her a hundred rupees for each night ’s performance. On the sixth night, A wilfully absents \nherself from the theatre, and B, in consequence, rescinds the contract. B must pay A for the five nights on which she had sung. \n(d) A contracts to sing for B at a concert for 1,000 rupees, which are paid in advance. A is too ill to sing. A is not bound to \nmake compensation to B for the loss of the profits which B would have made if A had been able to sing, but must refund to B the \n1,000 rupees paid in advance. \n66. Mode of communicating or revoking r escission of voidable contract .—The rescission of a \nvoidable contract may be communicated or revoked in the same manner, and subject to the same rules, as \napply to the communication or revocation of a proposal1. \n67. Effect of neglect of promisee to afford promisor reasonable facilities f or performance.—If \nany promisee neglects or refuses to afford the promisor reasonable facilities for the performance of his \npromise, the promisor is excused by such neglect or refusal as to any non-performance caused thereby. \nIllustration \nA contracts with B to repair B’s house. \nB neglects or refuses to point out to A the places in which his house requires repair. \nA is excused for the non-performance of the contract if it is caused by such neglector refusal. \nCHAPTER V \nOF CERTAIN RELATIONS RESEMBLING THOSE CREATED BY CONTRACT \n68. Claim for necessaries supplied to person incapable of contracting, or on hi s account.—If a \nperson, incapable of entering into a contract, or any one whom he is legally bound to support, is supplied \nby another person with necessaries suited to his condition in life, the person who has furni shed such \nsupplies is entitled to be reimbursed from the property of such incapable person.2 \nIllustrations \n(a) A supplies B, a lunatic, with necessaries suitable to his condition in life.

See ss. 3 and 5, supra. \n2. The property of a Government ward in Madhya Pradesh is not liable under this section, see the C.P. Court of Wards Act, 1899 \n(24 of 1899), s. 31(1). \n29 \n \nIllustration \nB holds land in Bengal, on a lease granted by A, the zamindar. The revenue payable by A to the Government being in arrear, \nhis land is advertised for sale by the Government. Under the revenue law, the consequence of such sale will be the annulment of \nB’s lease. B, to prevent the sale and the consequent annulment of his own lease, pays to the Governm ent the sum due from A. A \nis bound to make good to B the amount so paid. \n70.Obligation of person enjoying benefit of non -gratuitous act.—Where a person lawfully does \nanything for another person, or delivers anything to him, not intending to do so gratuitou sly, and such \nother person enjoys the benefit thereof, the latter is bound to make compensation to the former in respect \nof, or to restore, the thing so done or delivered1. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, a tradesman, leaves goods at B’s house by mistake. B treats the goods as his own. He is bound to pay A for them. \n(b) A saves B’s property from fire. A is not entitled to compensation from B, if the circumstances show that h e intended to \nact gratuitously. \n71.Responsibility of finder of goods .—A person who finds goods belonging to another, and takes \nthem into his custody, is subject to the same responsibility as a bailee2. \n72. Liability of person to whom money is paid , or thing delivere d, by mistake or under \ncoercion.—A person to whom money has been paid, or anything delivered, by mistake or under coercion, \nmust repay or return it. \nIllustrations \n(a)A and B jointly owe 100 rupees to C, A alone pays the amount to C, and B, not knowing this fact, pays 100 rupees over \nagain to C. C is bound to repay the amount to B. \n(b)A railway company refuses to deliver up certain goods to the consignee, except upon the payment of an illegal charge for \ncarriage. The consignee pays the sum charged in order to obtain the goods. He is entitled to recover so much of the cha rge as was \nillegally excessive. \nCHAPTER VI \nOF THE CONSEQUENCES OF BREACH OF CONTRACT \n73.Compensation for loss or damage caused by breach of contract .—When a contract has been \nbroken, the party who suffers by such breach is entitled to receive, from the party who has broken the \ncontract, compensation for any loss or damage caused to him thereby, which naturally arose in the usual \ncourse of things from such breach, or which the parties knew, when they made the contract, to be likely to \nresult from the breach of it. \nSuch compensation is not to be given for any remote and indirect loss or damage sus tained by reason \nof the breach. \nCompensation for failure to discharge obligation resemb ling those created by contract .—When \nan obligation resembling those created by contract ha s been incurred and has not been discharged, any \nperson injured by the failure to discharge it is entitled to receive the same compensation from the party in \ndefault, as if such person had contracted to discharge it and had broken his contract. \nExplanation.—In estimating the loss or damage arising from a breach of contract, the means which \nexisted of remedying the inconvenience caused by the non-performance of the contract must be taken into \naccount. \n \n \n1. As to suits by minors under s. 70 in Presidency Small Cause Courts, see the Presidency Small Cause Courts Act, 1882 \n(15 of 1882), s. 32. \n2. See ss. 151 and 152, infra. \n30 \n \nIllustrations \n(a)A contracts to sell and deliver 50 maunds of saltpetre to B, at a certain price to be paid on delivery. A breaks his promise. \nB is entitled to receive from A, by way of compensation, the sum, if any, by which the contract price falls short of the pric e for \nwhich B might have obtained 50 maunds of saltpetre of like quality at the time when the saltpetre ought to have been delivered. \n(b)A hires B’s ship to go to Bombay, and there take on board, on the first of January , a cargo, which A is to provide, and to \nbring it to Calcutta, the freight to be paid when earned. B ’s ship does not go to Bombay, but A has opportunities of procuring \nsuitable conveyance for the cargo upon terms as advantageous as those on which he had chartered the ship. A avails himself of \nthose opportunities, but is put to trouble and expense in doing so. A is entitled to receive compensation from B in respe ct of such \ntrouble and expense. \n(c)A contracts to buy of B, at a stated price, 50 maunds of rice, no time being fixed for delivery. A afterwards informs B that \nhe will not ac cept the rice if tendered to him. B is entitled to receive from A, by way of compensation, the amount, if any, by \nwhich the contract price exceeds that which B can obtain for the rice at the time when A informs B that he will not accept it. \n(d) A contracts to buy B ’s ship for 60,000 rupees, but breaks his promise. A must pay to B, by way of compensation, the \nexcess, if any, of the contract price over the price which B can obtain for the ship at the time of the breach of promise. \n(e) A, the owner of a boat, contracts with B to take a cargo of jute to Mirzapur, for sale at that place, starting on a specified \nday. The boat, owing to some avoidable cause, does not start at the time appointed, whereby the arrival of the cargo at Mirza pur \nis delayed beyond the time when it would have arrived if the boat had sailed according to the contract. After that date, and before \nthe arrival of the cargo, the price of jute falls. The measure of the compensation payable to B by A is the difference betwee n the \nprice which B coul d have obtained for the cargo at Mirzapur at the time when it would have arrived if forwarded in due course, \nand its market price at the time when it actually arrived. \n(f) A contracts to repair B ’s house in a certain manner, and receives payment in advance . A repairs the house, but not \naccording to contract. B is entitled to recover from A the cost of making the repairs conform to the contract. \n(g) A contracts to let his ship to B for a year, from the first of January, for a certain price. Freights rise, an d, on the first of \nJanuary, the hire obtainable for the ship is higher than the contract price. A breaks his promise. He must pay to B, by way o f \ncompensation, a sum equal to the difference between the contract price and the price for which B could hire a similar ship for a \nyear on and from the first of January. \n(h) A contracts to supply B with a certain quantity of iron at a fixed price, being a higher price than that for which A could \nprocure and deliver the iron. B wrongfully refuses to receive the iron. B must pay to A, by way of compensation, the differen ce \nbetween the contract price of the iron and the sum for which A could have obtained and delivered it. \n(i) A delivers to B, a common carrier, a machine, to be conveyed, without delay, to A ’s mill informing B that his mill is \nstopped for want of the machine. B unreasonably delays the delivery of the machine, and A, in consequence, loses a profitable \ncontract with the Government. A is entitled to receive from B, by way of compensation, the average amount of profit which \nwould have b een made by the working of the mill during the time that delivery of it was delayed, but not the loss sustained \nthrough the loss of the Government contract. \n(j) A, having contracted with B to supply B with 1,000 tons of iron at 100 rupees a ton, to be delivered at a stated time, \ncontracts with C for the pur chase of 1,000 tons of iron at 80 rupees a ton, telling C that he does so for the purpose of performing \nhis contract with B. C fails to perform his contract with A, who cannot procure other iron, and B, in consequence, rescinds the \ncontract. C must pay to A 20,000 rupees, being the profit which A would have made by the performance of his contract with B. \n(k) A contracts with B to make and deliver to B, by a fixed day, for a specified price, a certain piece of machinery. A does \nnot deliver the piece of machinery at the time specified, and in consequence of this, B is obliged to procure another at a high er \nprice than that which he was to have paid to A, and is prevented from performing a contract which B had made with a third \nperson at the time of his contract with A (but which had not been then communicated to A), and is compelled to make \ncompensation for breach of that contract. A must pay to B, by way of compensation, the differ ence between the contract price of \nthe piece of machinery and the sum paid by B for another, but not the sum paid by B to the third person by way of compensation. \n(l)A, a builder, contracts to erect and finish a house by the first of January, in order that B may give possession of it at th at \ntime to C, to wh om B has contracted to let it. A is informed of the contract between B and C. A builds the house so badly that, \nbefore the first of January, it falls down and has to be re -built by B, who, in consequence, loses the rent which he was to have \nreceived from C, and is obliged to make compensation to C for the breach of his contract. A must make compensation to B for \nthe cost of rebuilding the house, for the rent lost, and for the compensation made to C. \n(m)A sells certain merchandise to B, warranting it to be of a particular quality, and B, in reliance upon this warranty, sells it \nto C with a similar warranty. The goods prove to be not according to the warranty, and B becomes liable to pay C a sum of \nmoney by way of compensation. B is entitled to be reimbursed this sum by A. \n31 \n \n(n)A contracts to pay a sum of money to B on a day specified. A does not pay the money on that day , B, in consequence of \nnot receiving the money on that day, is unable to pay his debts, and is totally ruined. A is not liable to make good to B anything \nexcept the principal sum he contracted to pay, together with interest up to the day of payment. \n(o)A contracts to deliver 50 maunds of saltpetre to B on the first of January, at a certain pr ice. B afterwards, before the first \nof January, contracts to sell the saltpetre to C at a price higher than the market price of the first of January. A breaks his promise. \nIn estimating the compensation payable by A to B, the market price of the first of January, and not the profit which would \nhave arisen to B from the sale to C, is to be taken into account. \n(p)A contracts to sell and deliver 500 bales of cotton to B on a fixed day. A knows nothing of B ’s mode of conducting his \nbusiness. A breaks his promise, and B, having no cotton, is obliged to close his mill. A is not responsible to B for the loss caused \nto B by the closing of the mill. \n(q)A contracts to sell and deliver to B, on the first of January, certain cloth which B intends to manufacture in to caps of a \nparticular kind, for which there is no demand, except at that season. The cloth is not delivered till after the appointed tim e, and \ntoo late to be used that year in making caps. B is entitled to receive from A, by way of compensation, the diff erence between the \ncontract price of the cloth and its market price at the time of delivery, but not the profits which he expected to obtain by making \ncaps, nor the expenses which he has been put to in making preparation for the manufacture. \n(r)A, a ship-owner, contracts with B to convey him from Calcutta to Sydney in A ’s ship, sailing on the first of January, and \nB pays to A, by way of deposit, one -half of his passage-money. The ship does not sail on the first of January, and B, after being \nin consequence detained in Calcutta for some time and thereby put to some expense, proceeds to Sydney in another vessel, and, \nin consequence, arriving too late in Sydney, loses a sum of money. A is l iable to repay to B his deposit, with interest, and the \nexpense to which he is put by his detention in Calcutta, and the excess, if any, of the passage-money paid for the second ship over \nthat agreed upon for the first, but not the sum of money which B lost by arriving in Sydney too late. \n74. Compensation for breach of contrac t where penalty stipulated for .—1[When a contract has \nbeen broken, if a sum is named in the contract as the amount to be paid in case of such breach, or if the \ncontract contains any other stipulation by way of penalty, the party complaining of the breach is entitled, \nwhether or not actual damage or loss is proved to have been caused thereby, to receive from the party who \nhas broken the contract reasonable compensation not exceeding the amount so named or, as the case may \nbe, the penalty stipulated for. \nExplanation.—A stipulation for increased interest from the date of default may be a stipulation by \nway of penalty.] \nException.—When any person ente rs into any bail -bond, recogni zance or other instrument of the \nsame nature, or, under the provisions of any la w, or under the orders of the 2[Central Government] or of \nany 3[State Government ], gives any bond for the performance of any public duty or act in which the \npublic are interested, he shall be liable, upon breach of the condition of any such instrument, to pay t he \nwhole sum mentioned therein. \nExplanation.—A person who enters into a contract with Government does not necessarily thereby \nundertake any public duty, or promise to do an act in which the public are interested. \nIllustrations \n(a)A contracts with B to pay B Rs. 1,000, if he fails to pay B Rs. 500 on a given day. A fails to pay B Rs. 500 on that day. B \nis entitled to recover from A such compensation, not exceeding Rs. 1,000, as the Court considers reasonable. \n(b)A contracts with B that, if Apractises as a surgeon within Calcutta, he will pay B Rs. 5,000. A practises as a surgeon in \nCalcutta. B is entitled to such compensation; not exceeding Rs. 5,000, as the Court considers reasonable. \n(c)A gives a recognizance binding him in a pe nalty of Rs. 500 to appear in Court on a certain day. He forfeits his \nrecognizance. He is liable to pay the whole penalty. \n \n1. Subs. by Act 6 of 1899, s. 4, for the first paragraph of s. 74. \n2. Subs. by the A.O. 1937, for “Government of India”. \n3. Subs. by the A.O. 1950, for “Provincial Government”. \n32 \n \n1[(d)A gives B a bond for the repayment of Rs. 1,000 with interest at 12 per cent. at the end of six months, with a stipulation \nthat, in case of default, interest shall be payable at the rate of 75 per cent. from the date of default. This is a stipulation by way of \npenalty, and B is only entitled to recover from A such compensation as the Court considers reasonable. \n(e) A, who owes money to B a money-lender, undertakes to repay him by delivering to him 10 maunds of grain on a certain \ndate, and stipulates that, in the event of his not delivering the stipulated amount by the stipulated date, he shall be liabl e to deliver \n20 maunds. This is a stipulation by way of penalty, and B is only entitled to reasonable compensation in case of breach. \n(f) A undertakes to repay B a loan of Rs. 1,000 by five equal monthly instalments, with a stipulation that in default of \npayment of any instalment, the w hole shall become due. This stipulation is not by way of penalty, and the contract may be \nenforced according to its terms. \n(g) A borrows Rs. 100 from B and gives him a bond for Rs. 200 payable by five yearly instalments of Rs. 40, with a \nstipulation that, in default of payment of any instalment, the whole shall become due. This is a stipulation by way of penalty.] \n75.Party rightfully rescinding cont ract, entitled to compensation .—A person who rightfully \nrescinds a contract is entitled t o com pensation for any damage which he has sustained through the \nnon-fulfilment of the contract. \nIllustration \nA, a singer, contracts with B, the manager of a theatre, to sing at his theatre for two nights in every week during the next two \nmonths, and B engages to pay her 100 rupees for each night ’s performance. On the sixth night, A wilfully absents herself from \nthe theatre, and B, in cons equence, rescinds the contract. B is entitled to claim compensation for the damage which he has \nsustained through the non-fulfilment of the contract. \n[CHAPTER VII.—SALES OF GOODS.] Rep.by the Indian Sale of Goods Act, 1930 (3 of 1930), s. 65. \n76.[‘Goods’ of defined.] Rep. by s. 65,ibid. \n77.[‘Sale defined.] Rep. by s. 65,ibid. \n78.[Sale how effected.] Rep. by s. 65,ibid. \n79.[Transferofownershipofthingsold,whichhasyettobeascertained,madeorfinished.]Rep.bys. 65, ibid. \n80.

This is a contract of indemnity. \n125.Rights of indemnity -holder wh en sued .—The promisee in a contract of indemnity, acting \nwithin the scope of his authority, is entitled to recover from the promisor— \n(1) all damages which he may be compelled to pay in any suit in respect of any matter to which \nthe promise to indemnify applies; \n(2) all costs which he may be compelled to pay in any such suit if , in bringing or defending it, he \ndid not contravene the orders of the promisor, and acted as it would have been prudent for him to act \nin the absence of any contract of indemnity, or if the promisor authorized him to bring or defend the \nsuit; \n(3) all sums which he may have paid under the terms of any compromise of any such sui t, if the \ncompromise was not contrary to the orders of the promisor, and was one which it would have been \nprudent for the promisee to make in the absence of any contract of indemnity, or if the promisor \nauthorized him to compromise the suit. \n126. “Contract of guarantee ”, “surety”, “principal debtor ” and “creditor”.—A “contract of \nguarantee” is a contract to perform the promise, or discharge the liability, of a third person in case of his \ndefault. The person who gives the guarantee is called the “surety”; the person in respect of whose default \nthe guarantee is given is called the “principal debtor”, and the person to whom the guarantee is given is \ncalled the “creditor”. A guarantee may be either oral or written. \n127. Consideration for guarantee .—Anything done, or any promise made, for the benefit of the \nprincipal debtor, may be a sufficient consideration to the surety for giving the guarantee. \nIllustrations \n(a) B requests A to sell and deliver to him goods on credit. A agrees to do so, provided C will guarantee the payment of the \nprice of the goods. C promises to guarantee the payment in cons ideration of A’s promise to deliver the goods. This is a sufficient \nconsideration for C’s promise. \n(b) A sells and delivers goods to B. C afterwards requests A to forbear to sue B for the debt for a year, and promises that, if \nhe does so, C will pay for them in default of payment by B. A agrees to forbear as requested. This is a sufficient consideration for \nC’s promise. \n(c) A sells and delivers goods to B. C afterwards, without consideration, agrees to pay for them in defau lt of B. The \nagreement is void. \n35 \n \n128. Surety’s liability.—The liability of the surety is co - extensive with that of the principal debtor, \nunless it is otherwise provided by the contract. \nIllustration \nA guarantees to B the payment of a bill of exchange by C, the acceptor. The bill is dishonoured by C. A is liable , not only \nfor the amount of the bill, but also for any interest and charges which may have become due on it. \n129. “Continuing guarantee”.—A guarantee which extends to a series of transactions, is called a \n“continuing guarantee”. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, in consideration that B will employ C in collecting the rent of B ’s zamindari, promises B to be responsible, to the \namount of 5,000 rupees, for the due collection and payment by C of those rents. This is a continuing guarantee. \n(b) A guarantees payment to B, a tea -dealer, to the amount of £100, for any tea he may from time to time supply to C. B \nsupplies C with tea to above the value of £100, and C pays B for it. Afterwards , B supplies C with tea to the value of £200. C \nfails to pay. The guarantee given by A was a continuing guarantee, and he is accordingly liable to B to the extent of £100. \n(c) A guarantees payment to B of the price of five sacks of flour to be delivered by B to C and to be paid for in a month. B \ndelivers five sacks to C. C pays for them. Afterwards B delivers four sacks to C, which C does riot pay for. The guarantee given \nby A was not a continuing guarantee, and accordingly he is not liable for the price of the four sacks. \n130.Revocation of continuing guarantee.—A continuing guarantee may at any time be revoked by \nthe surety, as to future transactions, by notice to the creditor. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, in consideration of B ’s discounting, at A ’s request, bills of exchange for C, guarantees to B, for twelve months, the \ndue payment of all such bills to the extent of 5,000 rupees. B discounts bills for C to the extent of 2,000 rupees. Afterwards, at the \nend of three months, A revokes the guarantee. This revocation discharges A from all liability to B for any subsequent dis count. \nBut A is liable to B for the 2,000 rupees, on default of C. \n(b) A guarantees to B, to the extent of 10,000 rupees, that C shall pay all the bills that B shall draw upon him. B draws upon \nC. C accepts the bill. A gives notice of revocation. C dishonours the bill at maturity. A is liable upon his guarantee. \n131.Revocation of continuing guarantee by surety ’s death.—The death of the surety operates, in \nthe absence of any contract to the contrary, as a revocation of a continuing guarantee, so far as regards \nfuture transactions. \n132. Liability of two persons, primarily liable, not affected by arrangement between them that \none shall be surety on other ’s default.—Where two persons contract with a third person to undertake a \ncertain liability, and also contract with each other that one of them shall be liable only on the default of \nthe other, the third person not being a party to such contract, the liability of each of such two persons to \nthe third person under the first contract is not affected by the e xistence of the second contract, although \nsuch third person may have been aware of its existence. \nIllustration \nA and B make a joint and several promissory note to C. A makes it, in fact, as surety for B, and C knows this at the time \nwhen the note is made. The fact that A, to the knowledge of C, made the note as surety for B, is no answer to a suit by C against \nA upon the note. \n133.Discharge of surety by variance in terms of contract .—Any variance, made without the \nsurety’s consent, in the terms of the contract between the principal 1[debtor] and the creditor, discharges \nthe surety as to transactions subsequent to the variance. \nIllustrations \n(a) A becomes surety to C for B ’s conduct as a manager in C ’s bank. Afterwards, B and C contract, without A ’s consent, \nthat B’s salary shall be raised, and that he shall become liable for one -fourth of the losses on overdrafts. B allows a customer to \n \n1. Ins. by Act 24 of 1917, s. 2 and the first Schedule. \n36 \n \noverdraw, and the bank loses a sum of money. A is discharged from his suretyship by the variance made without his c onsent, and \nis not liable to make good this loss. \n(b) A guarantees C against the misconduct of B in an office to which B is appointed by C, and of which the duties are \ndefined by an Act of the Legislature. By a subsequent Act, the nature of the office is m aterially altered. Afterwards, B \nmisconducts himself. A is discharged by the change from future liability under his guarantee, though the misco nduct of B is in \nrespect of a duty not affected by the later Act. \n(c) C agrees to appoint B as his clerk to sell goods at a yearly salary, upon A’s becoming surety to C for B’s duly accounting \nfor moneys received by him as such clerk. Afterwards, without A ’s knowledge or consent, C and B agree that B should be paid \nby a commission on the goods sold by him and not by a fixed salary. A is not liable for subsequent misconduct of B. \n(d) A gives to C a continuing guarantee to the extent of 3,000 rupees for any oil supplied by C to B on credit. Afterwards B \nbecomes embarrassed, and, without the knowledge of A, B and C contr act that C shall continue to supply B with oil for ready \nmoney, and that the paymen ts shall be applied to the then, existing debts between B and C. A is not liable on his guarantee for \nany goods supplied after: this new arrangement. \n(e) C contracts to lend B 5,000 rupees on the 1st March. A guarantees repayment. C pays the 5,000 rupees to B on the 1st \nJanuary. A is discharged from his liability, as the contract has been varied, inasmuch as C might sue B for the money before the \n1st of March. \n134.Discharge of surety by release or discharge of principal debtor.—The surety is discharged by \nany contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, by which the principal debtor is released, or by \nany act or omission of the creditor, the legal consequence of which is the dis charge of the principal \ndebtor. \nIllustrations \n(a) A gives a guarantee to C for goods to be supplied by C to B. C supplies goods to B, and afterwards B becomes \nembarrassed and contracts with his creditors (including C) to assign to them his property in consideration of their releasing him \nfrom their demands. Here B is released from his debt by the contract with C, and A is discharged from his suretyship. \n(b) A contracts w ith B to grow a crop of indigo o n A’s land and to deliver it to B at a fixed rate, and C guarantees A ’s \nperformance of this contract. B diverts a stream of water which is necessary for the irrigation of A ’s land and thereby prevents \nhim from raising the indigo. C is no longer liable on his guarantee. \n(c) A contracts with B for a fixed price to build a house for B within a stipulated time, B supplying the necessary timber. C \nguarantees A’s performance of the contract. B omits to supply the timber. C is discharged from his suretyship. \n135. Discharge of surety when creditor compounds with, gives time to, or agree s not to sue, \nprincipal debtor.—A contract between the creditor and the principal debtor, by which the creditor makes \na composition with, or promises to give time to, or not to sue, the principal debtor, discharges the surety, \nunless the surety assents to such contract. \n136. Surety not discharged when agreement made with third person to give time to pri ncipal \ndebtor.—Where a contract to give time to the principal debtor is made by the creditor with a third \nperson, and not with the principal debtor, the surety is not discharged. \nIllustration \nC, the holder of an overdue bill of exchange drawn by A as surety for B, and accepted by B, contracts with M to give time to \nB. A is not discharged. \n137. Creditor’s forbearance to sue does not discharge surety .—Mere forbearance on the part of \nthe creditor to sue the principal debtor or to enforce any other remedy against him does not, in the absence \nof any provision in the guarantee to the contrary, discharge the surety. \nIllustration \nB owes to C a debt guaranteed by A. The debt becomes payable. C does not sue B for a year after the debt has become \npayable. A is not discharged from his suretyship. \n37 \n \n138.Release of one co-surety does not discharge others.—Where there are co-sureties, a release by \nthe creditor of one of them does not discharge the others; neither does it free the surety so released from \nhis responsibility to the other sureties1. \n139. Discharge of surety by creditor ’s act or omission impairing surety ’s eventual remedy.—If \nthe creditor does any act which is inconsistent with the rights of the surety, or omits to do any act which \nhis duty to the surety requires him to do, and the eventual remedy of the surety himself against the \nprincipal debtor is thereby impaired, the surety is discharged. \nIllustrations \n(a) B contracts to build a ship for C for a given sum, to be paid by instalments as the work reaches certain stages. A becomes \nsurety to C for B ’s due performance of the contract. C, without the knowledge of A, prepays to B the last two instalments. A is \ndischarged by this prepayment. \n(b) C lends money to B on the security of a joint and several promissory note made in C ’s favour by B, and by A as surety \nfor B, together with a bill of sale of B ’s furniture, which gives power to C to sell the furniture, and apply the proceeds in \ndischarge of the note. Subsequently, C sells the furniture, but, owing to his misconduct and wilful negligence, only a small price \nis realized. A is discharged from liability on the note. \n(c) A puts M as apprentice to B, and gives a guarantee to B for M’s fidelity. B promises on his part that he will, at least once \na month, see M make up the cash. B omits to see this done as promised, and M embezzles. A is not liable to B on his guarantee. \n140.Rights of surety on payment or performance.—Where a guaranteed debt has become due, or \ndefault of the principal debtor to perform a guaranteed du ty has taken place, the surety upon payment or \nperformance of all that he is liable for, is invested with all the rights which the creditor ha d against the \nprincipal debtor. \n141.Surety’s right to benefit of creditor ’s securities.—A surety is entitled to the benefit of every \nsecurity which the creditor has against the principal debtor at the time when the contract of suretyship is \nentered into, whether the surety knows of the ex istence of such security or not ; and if the creditor loses, \nor, without the consent of the surety, parts with such security, the surety is discharged to the exten t of the \nvalue of the security. \nIllustrations \n(a)C, advances to B, his tenant, 2,000 rupees on the guarantee of A. C has also a further security for the 2,000 rupees by a \nmortgage of B ’s furniture. C cancels the mortgage. B becomes insolvent and C sues A on his guarantee. A is discharged from \nliability to the amount of the value of the furniture. \n(b)C, a creditor, whose advance to B is secured by a decree, receives also a guarantee for that advance from A. C afterwards \ntakes B’s goods in execution under the decree, and then, without the knowledge of A, withdraws the execution. A is discharged. \n(c)A, as surety for B, makes a bond jointly with B to C, to secure a loan from C to B. Afterwards, C obtains from B a further \nsecurity for the same debt. Subsequently, C gives up the further security. A is not discharged. \n142. Guarantee obtained by misrepresentation invalid.—Any guarantee which has been obtained \nby means of misrepresentation made by the creditor, or with his knowledge and assent, concerning a \nmaterial part of the transaction, is invalid. \n143. Guarantee obtained by concealment invalid.—Any guarantee which the creditor has obtained \nby means of keeping silence as to material circumstances, is invalid. \nIllustrations \n(a)A engages B as clerk to collect money for him. B fails to account for some of his receipts, and A in consequence calls \nupon him to furnish security for his duly accounting. C gives his guarantee for B ’s duly accounting. A does not acquaint C with \nB’s previous conduct. B afterwards makes default. The guarantee is invalid. \n \n1. See s. 44, supra. \n38 \n \n(b)A guarantees to C payment fo r iron to be supplied by him to B to the amount of 2,000 tons. B and C have privately \nagreed that B should pay five rupees per ton beyond the market price, such excess to be applied in liquidation of an old debt . This \nagreement is concealed from A. A is not liable as a surety. \n144. Guarantee on contract that creditor shall not a ct on it until co -surety joins .—Where a \nperson gives a guarantee upon a contract that the creditor shall not act upon it until another person has \njoined in it as co-surety, the guarantee is not valid if that other person does not join. \n145.Implied promise to indemnify surety .—In every contract of guarantee there is an implied \npromise by the principal debtor to indemnify the surety, and the surety is entitled to recover from the \nprincipal debtor whatever sum he has rightfully paid under the guarantee, but, no sums which he has paid \nwrongfully. \nIllustrations \n(a)B is indebted to C, and A is surety for the debt. C demands payment from A, and on his refusal sues him for the amount. \nA defends the suit, having reasonable grounds for doing so, but is compelled to pay the amount of the debt with costs. He can \nrecover from B the amount paid by him for costs, as well as the principal debt. \n(b)C lends B a sum of money, and A, at the request of B, accepts a bill of exchange drawn by B upon A to secure the \namount. C, the holder of the bill, demands payment of it from A, and, on A ’s refusal to pay, sues him upon the bill. A, not having \nreasonable grounds for so doing, defends the suit, and has t o pay the amount of the bill and costs. He can recover from B the \namount of the bill, but not the sum paid for costs, as there was no real ground for defending the action. \n(c)A guarantees to C, to the extent of 2,000 rupees, payment for rice to be supplied by C to B. C supplies to B rice to a less \namount than 2,000 rupees, but obtains from A payment of the sum of 2,000 rupees i n respect of the rice supplied. A cannot \nrecover from B more than the price of the rice actually supplied. \n146. Co-sureties liable t o contribute equally.—Where two or more persons are co -sureties for the \nsame debt or duty, either jointly or severally, and whether under the same or different contracts, and \nwhether with or without the knowledge of each other, the co-sureties, in the absence of any contract to the \ncontrary, are liable, as between themselves, to pay each an equal share of the whole debt, or of that part of \nit which remains unpaid by the principal debtor1. \nIllustrations \n(a)A, B and C are sureties to D for the sum of 3,000 rupees lent to E. E makes default in payment. A, B and C are l iable, as \nbetween themselves, to pay 1,000 rupees each. \n(b)A, B and C are sureties to D for the sum of 1,000 rupees lent to E, and there is a contract between A, B and C that A is to \nbe responsible to the extent of one -quarter, B to the extent of one - quarter, and C to the extent of one-half. E makes default in \npayment. As between the sureties, A is liable to pay 250 rupees, B 250 rupees, and C 500 rupees. \n147.Liability of co-sureties bound in different sums.—Co-sureties who are bound in different sums \nare liable to pay equally as far as the limits of their respective obligations permit. \nIllustrations \n(a)A, B and C, as sureties for D, enter into three several bonds, each in a different penalty, namely, A in the penalty of each \n10,000 rupees, B in that of 20,000 rupees, C in that of 40,000 rupees, conditioned for D ’s duly accounting to E. D makes default \nto the extent of 30,000 rupees. A, B and C are each liable to pay 10,000 rupees. \n(b)A, B and C, as sureties for D, enter into three several bonds, each in a different penalty, namely, A in the penalty of \n10,000 rupees, B in that of 20,000 rupees, C in that of 40,000 rupees, conditioned for D ’s duly accounting to E. D makes default \nto the extent of 40,000 rupees. A is liable to pay 10,000 rupees, and B and C 15,000 rupees each. \n(c)A, B and C, as sureties for D, enter into three several bonds, each in a different penalty, namely, A in the penalty of \n10,000 rupees, B in that of 20,000 rupees , C in that of 40,000 rupees, conditioned for D ’s duly accounting to E. D makes default \nto the extent of 70,000 rupees. A, B and C have to pay each the full penalty of his bond. \n \n \n1. See s. 43, supra. \n39 \n \nCHAPTER IX \nOF BAILMENT \n148.“Bailment”“bailor” and “bailee” defined.—A “bailment” is the delivery of goods by one \nperson to another for some purpose, upon a contract that they shall, when the purpose is accomplished, be \nreturned or otherwise disposed of according to the directions of the person delivering them. The person \ndelivering the goods is called the “bailor”. The person to whom they are delivered is called, the “bailee”. \nExplanation.—If a person already in possession of the goods of another contracts to hold them as a \nbailee, he thereby becomes the bailee, and the owner becomes th e bailor of such goods, although they \nmay not have been delivered by way of bailment. \n149. Delivery to bailee how made .—The delivery to the bailee may be made by doing anything \nwhich has the effect of putting the goods in the possession of the intended bai lee or of any person \nauthorized to hold them on his behalf. \n150.Bailor’s duty to d isclose faults in goods bailed .—The bailor is bound to disclose to the bailee \nfaults in the goods bailed, of which the bailor is aware, and which materially interfere with the use of \nthem, or expose the bailee to extraordinary risks; and if he does not make such disclosure, he is \nresponsible for damage arising to the bailee directly from such faults. \nIf the goods are bailed for hire, the bailor is responsible for such damage , whether he was or was not \naware of the existence of such faults in the goods bailed. \nIllustrations \n(a)A lends a horse, which he knows to be vicious, to B. He does not disclose the fact that the horse is vicious. The horse \nruns away. B is thrown and injured. A is responsible to B for damage sustained. \n(b)A hires a carriage of B. The carriage is unsafe, though B is not aware of it, and A is injured. B is r esponsible to A for the \ninjury. \n1151. Care to be taken by bailee .—In all cases of bailment the bai lee is bound to take as much care \nof the goods bailed to him as a man of ordinary prudence would, under similar circumstances, take of his \nown goods of the same bulk, quality and value as the goods bailed2. \n152.Bailee when not liable for loss, etc., of thing bailed.—The bailee, in the absence of any special \ncontract, is not responsible for the loss, destruction or deterioration of the thing bailed, if he has taken the \namount of care of it described in section 151. \n153. Termination of bailment by bailee ’s act inconsistent with conditions .—A contract of \nbailment is avoidable at the option of the bailor, if the bailee does any act with regard to the goods bailed, \ninconsistent with the conditions of the bailment. \nIllustration \nA lets to B, for hire, a horse for his own riding. B drives the horse in his carriage. This is, at the ‘option of A, a termination \nof the bailment. \n154. Liability of bailee making unauthorized use of goods bailed.—If the bailee makes any use of \nthe goods bailed which is not according to the conditions of the bailment, he is liable to make \ncompensation to the bailor for any damage arising to the goods from or during such use of them. \n \n1. The responsibility of the Trustees of the Port of Madras constituted under the Madras Port Trust Act, 1905 (Madras Act \n2 of 1905), in regard to goods has been declared to be that of a bailee under these sections, without the qualifying words “i n the \nabsence of any special contract” in s. 152, see s. 40(1) of that Act. \n2.As to railway contracts see the Indian Railways Act, 1890 (9 of 1890), s. 72. As to the liability of common carriers, see the \nCarriers Act, 1865 (3 of 1865), s. 8. \n40 \n \nIllustrations \n(a)A lends a horse to B for his own riding only. B allows C, a member of his family, to ride the horse. C rides with c are, but \nthe horse accidentally falls and is injured. B is liable to make compensation to A for the injury done to the horse. \n(b)A hires a horse in Calcutta from B expressly to marc h to Benares. A rides with due care, but marches to Cuttack instead. \nThe horse accidentally falls and is injured. A is liable to make compensation to B for the injury to the horse. \n155. Effect of mixture, with bailor ’s consent, of his goods with bailee ’s.—If the bailee, with the \nconsent of the bailor, mixes the goods of the bailor with his own goods, the bailor and the bailee shall \nhave an interest, in proportion to their respective shares, in the mixture thus produced. \n156.Effect of mixture without bailor’s consent, when the goods can be separated .—If the bailee, \nwithout the consent of the bailor, mixes the goods of the bailor with his own goods, and the goods can be \nseparated or divided, the property in the goods remains in the parties respectively; but the bailee is bound \nto bear the expense of separation or division, and any damage arising from the mixture. \nIllustration \nA bails 100 bales of cotton marked with a particular mark to B. B, without A’s consent, mixes the 100 bales with other bales \nof his own, bearing a different mark: A is entitled to have his 100 bales returned, and B is bound to bear all the expense incurred \nin the separation of the bales, and any other incidental damage. \n157. Effect of mixture, without bailor ’s consent, when the goods cannot be separated.—If the \nbailee, without the consent of the bailor, mixes the goods of the bailor with his own goods, in such a \nmanner that it is impossible to separate the go ods bailed from the other goods, and deliver them back, the \nbailor is entitled to be compensated by the bailee for the loss of the goods. \nIllustration \nA bails a barrel of Cape flour worth Rs. 45 to B. B, without A ’s consent, mixes the flour with country flour of his own, \nworth only Rs. 25 a barrel. B must compensate A for the loss of his flour. \n158. Repayment, by bailor, of necessary expenses.—Where, by the conditions of the bailment, the \ngoods are to be kept or to be carried, or to have work done upon them by the bailee for the bailor, and the \nbailee is to receive no remuneration, the bailor shall repay to the bailee the necessary expenses incurred \nby him for the purpose of the bailment. \n159.Restoration of goods lent gratuitously .—The lender of a thing for use may at any time require \nits return, if the loan was gratuitous, even though h e lent it for a specified time or purpose. But if, on the \nfaith of such loan made for a specified time or purpose, the borrowe r has acted in such a manner that the \nreturn of the thing lent before the time agreed upon would cause him loss exceeding the bene fit actually \nderived by him from the loan, the lender must, if he compels the return, indemnify the borrower for the \namount in which the loss so occasioned exceeds the benefit so derived. \n160.Return of goods bailed, on expiration of time or acc omplishment of purpose.—It is the duty \nof the bailee to return, or deliver according to the bailor’s directions, the goods bailed, without demand, as \nsoon as the time for which they were bailed has expired, or the purpose for which they were bailed has \nbeen accomplished. \n1161. Bailee’s responsibility wh en goods are not duly returned .—If, by the default of the bailee, \nthe goods are not returned, delivered or tendered at the proper time, he is responsible to the bailor for any \nloss, destruction or deterioration of the goods from that time.2 \n \n1. S. 161 has been declared to apply to the responsibility of the Trustees of the Port of Madras as to goods in their possess ion \nseethe Madras Port Trust Act, 1905 (Madras Act 2 of 1905). \n2. As to Railway contracts, see the Indian Railways Act, 1890 (9 of 1890), s. 72. \n41 \n \n162. Termination of gratuitous bailment by death .—A gratuitous bailment is terminated by the \ndeath either of the bailor or of the bailee. \n163. Bailor entitled to increase or profit from goods bailed.—In the absence of any contract to the \ncontrary, the bailee is bound to deliver to the bailor, or according to his directions, any increase or profit \nwhich may have accrued from the goods bailed. \nIllustration \nA leaves a cow in the custody of B to be taken care of. The cow has a calf. B is bound to deliver the calf as well as the cow \nto A. \n164. Bailor’s responsibility to bailee.—The bailor is responsible to the bailee for any loss which the \nbailee may sustain by reason that the bailor was not entitled to make the bailment, or to receive back the \ngoods, or to give directions respecting them. \n165.Bailment by several joint owners .—If several joint owners of goods bail them, the bailee may \ndeliver them back to, or according to the directions of, one joint ow ner without the consent of all in the \nabsence of any agreement to the contrary. \n166.Bailee not responsible on re -delivery to bailor without title .—If the bailor has no title to the \ngoods, and the bailee, in good faith, delivers them back to, or according to the directions of, the bailor, the \nbailee is not responsible to the owner in respect of such delivery1. \n167.Right of third person claiming goods bailed .—If a person, other than t he bailor, claims goods \nbailed he may apply to the Court to stop the delivery of the goods to the bailor, and to decide the title to \nthe goods. \n168.Right of finder of goods, may sue for specific reward offered .—The finder of goods has no \nright to sue the owner for com pensation for trouble and expense voluntarily incurred by him to preserve \nthe goods and to find out the owner; but he may retain the goods against the owner until he receives such \ncompensation; and, where the owner has offered a specific reward for the ret urn of goods lost, the finder \nmay sue for such reward, and may retain the goods until he receives it. \n169.When finder of thin g commonly on sale may sell it .—When a thing which is commonly the \nsubject of sale is lost, if the owner cannot with reasonable dil igence be found, or if he refuses, upon \ndemand, to pay the lawful charges of the finder, the finder may sell it— \n(1) when the thing is in danger of perishing or of losing the greater part of its value, or, \n(2) when the lawful charges of the finder, in resp ect of the thing found, amo unt to two -thirds of \nits value. \n170. Bailee ’s particular li en.—Where the bailee has, in accordance with the purpose of the \nbailment, rendered any service involving the exercise of labour or skill in respect of the goods bailed, he \nhas, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, a right to retain such goods until he receives due \nremuneration for the services he has rendered in respect of them. \nIllustrations \n(a) A delivers a rough diamond to B, a jeweller, to be cut and polished, which is accordingly done. B is entitled to retain the \nstone till he is paid for the services he has rendered. \n(b) A gives, cloth to B, a tailor, to make into a coat. B promises A to deliver the coat as soon as it is finished, and to give a \nthree months’ credit for the price. B is not entitled to retain the coat until he is paid. \n \n1.

Pawnee’s right as to extraordinary expenses incurred. —Thepawnee is entitled to receive \nfrom the pawnor extraordinary expenses incurred by him for the preservation of the goods pledged. \n176.

If the proceeds of the sale are greater than the amount so due, the pawnee \nshall pay over the surplus to the pawnor. \n177. Defaulting pawner’s right to redeem .—If a time is stipulated for the payment of the debt, o r \nperformance of the promise, for which the pledge is made, and the pawnor makes default in payment of \nthe debt or performance of the promise at the stipulated time, he may redeem the goods pledged at any \nsubsequent time before the actual sale of them 2; but he must, in that case, pay, in addition, any expenses \nwhich have arisen from his default. \n3[178.

Consideration not necessary.—No consideration is necessary to create an agency. \n186. Agent’s authority may be expressed or implied.—The authority of an agent may be expressed \nor implied1. \n187. Definitions of express and implied authority .—An authority is said to be express when it is \ngiven by words spoken or written. An authority is said to be implied when it is to be inferred from the \ncircumstances of the case; and things spoken or written, or the ordinary course of dealing, may be \naccounted circumstances of the case. \nIllustration \nA owns a shop in Serampore, living himself in Calcutta, and visi ting the shop occasionally. The shop is managed by B, and \nhe is in the habit of ordering goods from C in the name of A for the purposes of the shop, and of paying for them out of A’s funds \nwith A’s knowledge.

Extent of agent ’s authority.—An agent, having an authority to do an act , has authority to do \nevery lawful thing which is necessary in order to do such act. \nAn agent having an authority to carry on a business, has authority to do every lawful thing necessary \nfor the purpose, or usually done in the course, of conducting such business. \n \n \n1. See, however, the Registration Act, 1908 (16 of 1908), s. 33; see also the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (5 of 1908), Sch. I, \nOrder III, rule 4. \n44 \n \nIllustrations \n(a) A is employed by B, residing in London, to recover at Bombay a debt due to B. A may adopt any legal process necessary \nfor the purpose of recovering the debt, and may give a valid discharge for the same. \n(b) A constitutes B his agent to carry on his business of a ship-builder. B may purchase timber and other materials, and hire \nworkmen, for the purpose of carrying on the business. \n189.Agent’s authority in an emergency .—An agent has authority, in an emergency, to do all such \nacts for the purpose of protecting his principal from loss as would be done by a person of ordinary \nprudence, in his own case, under similar circumstances. \nIllustrations \n(a) An agent for sale may have goods repaired if it be necessary. \n(b) A consigns provisions to B at Calcutta, with directions to send them immediately to C, at Cuttack. B may sell the \nprovisions at Calcutta, if they will not bear the journey to Cuttack without spoiling. \nSub-Agents \n190. When agent cannot delegate .—An agent cannot lawfully employ another to perform acts \nwhich he has expressly or impliedly undertaken to perform personally, unless by the ordinary custom of \ntrade a sub-agent may, or, from the nature of the agency, a sub-agent must, be employed. \n191. “Sub-agent” defined.—A “sub-agent” is a person employed by, and acting under the control of, \nthe original agent in the business of the agency. \n192.

B names C, an \nauctioneer, to conduct the sale. C is not a sub-agent, but is A’s agent for the conduct of the sale. \n(b)A authorizes B, a merchant in Calcutta, to recover the moneys due to A from C & Co.

Agent’s duty in naming such person .—In selecting such agent for his principal, an agent is \nbound to exercise the same amount of discretion as a man of ordinary prudence would exercise in his own \ncase; and, if he does this, he is not responsible to the principal for the acts or negli gence of the agent so \nselected. \n45 \n \nIllustrations \n(a)A instructs B, a merchant, to buy a ship for him. B employs a ship -surveyor of good reputation to choose a ship for A. \nThe surveyor makes the choice negligently and the ship turns out to be unseaworthy and is lost. B is not, but the surveyor is, \nresponsible to A. \n(b)A consigns goods to B, a merchant, for sale. B, in due course, employs an auctioneer in good credit to sell the goods of A, \nand allows the auctioneer to rece ive the proceeds of the sale. The auctioneer afterwards becomes insolvent without hav ing \naccounted for the proceeds. B is not responsible to A for the proceeds. \nRatification \n196. Right of person as to acts done for him without his authority . Effect of ratification.—\nWhere acts are done by one person on behalf of another, but without his knowledge or authority, he may \nelect to ratify or to disown such acts. If he ratify them, the same effects will follow as if they had b een \nperformed by his authority. \n197.Ratification may be expressed or implied .—Ratification may be expressed or may be implied \nin the conduct of the person on whose behalf the acts are done. \nIllustrations \n(a)A, without authority, buys goods for B. Afterwards B sells them to C on his own account; B ’s conduct implies a \nratification of the purchase made for him by A. \n(b)A, without B’s authority, lends B’s money to C. Afterwards B accepts interest on the money from C. B ’s conduct implies \na ratification of the loan. \n198.Knowledge re quisite for valid ratification .—No valid ratification can be made by a person \nwhose knowledge of the facts of the case is materially defective. \n199.Effect of ratifying unauthorized act forming part of a transaction .—A person ratifying any \nunauthorized act done on his behalf ratifies the whole of the transaction of which such act formed a part. \n200.Ratification of unauthorized act cannot injure third person .—An act done by one person on \nbehalf of another, without such other person ’s authority, which, if done with autho rity, would have the \neffect of subjecting a third person to damages, or of terminating any right or interest of a third person, \ncannot, by ratification, be made to have such effect. \n Illustrations \n(a)A, not being authorized thereto by B, demands, on behalf of B, the delivery of a chattel, the property of B, from C, who is \nin possession of it. This demand cannot be ratified by B, so as to make C liable for damages for his refusal to deliver. \n(b)A holds a lease from B, terminable on three months ’ notice. C, an unauthorized person, gives notice of termination to A. \nThe notice cannot be ratified by B, so as to be binding on A. \nRevocation of Authority \n201. Termination of agency .—An agency is terminated by the principal revoking his authority; or \nby the agent renouncing the business of the agency; or by the business of the agency being completed; or \nby either the principal or agent dying or becoming of unsound mind; or by the principal being adjudicated \nan insolvent under the provisions of any Act for the time being in force for the relief of insolvent debtors. \n202.Termination of agency, where agent has an interest in subject-matter.—Where the agent has \nhimself an interest in the property which forms the subject-matter of the agency, the agency cannot, in the \nabsence of an express contract, be terminated to the prejudice of such interest. \nIllustrations \n(a) A gives authority to B to sell A ’s land, and to pay himself, out of the proceeds, the debts due to him from A. A cannot \nrevoke this authority, nor can it be terminated by his insanity or death. \n46 \n \n(b) A consigns 1,000 bales of cotton to B, who has made advances to him on such cotton, and desires B to sell the cotton, \nand to repay himself out of the price, the amount of his own advances. A cannot revoke this authority, nor is it termi nated by his \ninsanity or death. \n203.When principal may revoke agent ’s authority .—The principal may, save as is otherwise \nprovided by the last preceding section, revoke the authority given to his agent at any time before the \nauthority has been exercised so as to bind the principal. \n204.Revocation where autho rity has been partly exercised .—The principal cannot revoke the \nauthority given to his agent after the authority has been partly exercised, so far as regards such acts and \nobligations as arise from acts already done in the agency. \nIllustrations \n(a)A authorizes B to buy 1,000 bales of cotton on account of A, and to pay for it out of A ’s moneys remaining in B’s hands. \nB buys 1,000 bales of cotton in his own name, so as to make himself personally liable for the price. A cannot revoke B ’s \nauthority so far as regards payment for the cotton. \n(b) A authorizes B to buy 1,000 bales of cotton on account of A, and to pay for it out of A’s moneys remaining in B’s hands. \nB buys 1,000 bales of cotton in A ’s name, and so as not to render himself personally liable for the price. A can revoke B ’s \nauthority to pay for the cotton. \n205.Compensation for revocation by principal, o r renunciation by agent .—Where there is an \nexpress or implied contract that the agency should be continued for any period of time, the principal must \nmake compensation to the agent, or the agent to the principal, as the case may be, for any previous \nrevocation or renunciation of the agency without sufficient cause. \n206. Notice of revocation or renunciation.—Reasonable notice must be given of such revocation or \nrenunciation, otherwise the damage thereby resulting to the principal or the agent, as the case may be, \nmust be made good to the one by the other. \n207.Revocation and renunciatio n may be expressed or implied .—Revocation and renunciation \nmay be expressed or may be implied in the conduct of the principal or agent respectively. \nIllustration \nA empowers B to let A ’s house. Afterwards A lets it himself. This is an implied revocation of \nB’s authority. \n208.When termination of agent ’s authority takes effect as to agent, and as to third persons .—\nThe termination of the authority of an agent does not, so far as regards th e agent, take effect before it \nbecomes known to him, or, so far as regards third persons, before it becomes known to them. \nIllustrations \n(a) A directs B to sell goods for him, and agrees to give B five per cent. commission on the price fetched by the goods. A \nafterwards, by letter, revoke B’s authority. B, after the letter is sent, but before he receives it, sells the goods for 100 rupees. The \nsale is binding on A, and B is entitled to five rupees as his commission. \n(b) A, at Madras, by letter, directs B to sell for him some cotton lying in a warehouse in Bombay, and afterwards, by letter, \nrevokes his authority to sell, and directs B to send the cotton to Madras. B, after receiving the second letter, enters into a contract \nwith C, who knows of the first letter, but not of the second, for the sale to him of the cotton. C pays B the money, with which B \nabsconds. C’s payment is good as against A. \n(c) A directs B, his agent, to pay certain money to C. A dies, and D takes out probate to his will. B, after A ’s death, but \nbefore hearing of it, pays the money to C. The payment is good as against D, the executor. \n209.Agent’s duty on termination of agency by principal’s death or insanity.—When an agency is \nterminated by the principal dying or becoming of unsound mi nd, the agent is bound to take, on behalf of \nthe representatives of his late principal, all reasonable steps for the protection and preservation of the \ninterests entrusted to him. \n47 \n \n210. Termination of sub -agent’s authority.—The termination of the authority of an agent causes \nthe termination (subject to the rules herein contained regarding the termination of an agent ’s authority) of \nthe authority of all sub-agents appointed by him. \nAgent’s duty to principal \n211.Agent’s duty in conducting principal ’s business.—An agent is bound to conduct the business \nof his principal according to the directions given by the principal, or, in the absence of any such \ndirections, according to the custom which prevails in doing business of the same kind at the place where \nthe agent conducts such business. When the agent acts otherwise, if any loss be sustained, he must make it \ngood to his principal, and if any profit accrues, he must account for it. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, an agent engaged in carrying on for B a business, in which it is the custom to invest from time to time, at interest, the \nmoneys which may be in hand, omits to make such investment. A must make good to B the interest usuall y obtained by such \ninvestments. \n(b) B, a broker, in whose business it is not the custom to sell on credit, sells goods of A on credit to C, whose credit at the \ntime was very high. C, before payment, becomes insolvent. B must make good the loss to A. \n212. Skill and diligence required from agent .—An agent is bound to conduct the business of the \nagency with as much skill as is generally possessed by perso ns engaged in similar business , unless the \nprincipal has notice of his want of skill. The agent is always bound to act with reasonable diligence, and \nto use such skill as he possesses; and to make compe nsation to his principal in respect of the direct \nconsequences of his own neglect, want of skill, or misconduct, but not in respect of loss or damage which \nare indirectly or remotely caused by such neglect, want of skill, or misconduct. \nIllustrations \n(a)A, a merchant in Calcutta, has an agent, B, in London, to whom a sum of money is paid on A ’s account, with orders to \nremit. B retains the money for a considerable time. A, in consequence of not receiving the money, becomes insolvent. B is lia ble \nfor the mone y and interest from the day on which it ought to have been paid, according to the usual rate, and for any further \ndirect loss-as, e.g., by variation of rate of exchange-but not further. \n(b)A, an agent for the sale of goods, having authority to sell on credit, sells to B on credit, without making the proper and \nusual enquiries as to the solvency of B. B, at the time of such sale, is insolvent. A must make compensation to his principal in \nrespect of any loss thereby sustained. \n(c)A, an insurance-broker employed by B to effect an insurance on a ship , omits to see that the usual clauses are inserted in \nthe policy. The ship is after wards lost. In consequence of the omission of the clauses nothing can be recovered from the \nunderwriters. A is bound to make good the loss to B. \n(d)A, a merchant in England, directs B, his agent at Bombay, who accepts the agency, to send him 100 bales of cotton by a \ncertain ship. B, having it in his power to send the cotton, omits to do so. The ship arrives safely in England. Soon after her arrival \nthe price of cotton rises. B is bound to make good to A the profit which he might have made by the 100 bales of cotton at the time \nthe ship arrived, but not any profit he might have made by the subsequent rise. \n213.Agent’s accounts.—An agent is bound to render proper accounts to his principal on demand. \n214.Agent’s duty to communicate with principal.—It is the duty of an agent, in cases of difficulty, \nto use all reasonable diligence in communicating with his principal, and in seeking to obtain his \ninstructions. \n215.Right of principal when agent deals, on his own account, in business of agency without \nprincipal’s consent.—If an agent deals on his own account in the business of the agency, without first \nobtaining the consent of his principal and acquainting him with all material circumstances which have \ncome to his own knowledge on the subject, the principal may repudiate the transaction, if the case shows , \neither that any material fact has been dishonestly concealed from him by the agent, or that the dealings of \nthe agent have been disadvantageous to him. \n \n48 \n \nIllustrations \n(a)A directs B to sell A ’s estate. B buys the estate for himself in the name of C. A, on discovering that B has bought the \nestate for himself, may repudiate the sale, if he can show that B has dishonestly concealed any material fact, or that the sa le has \nbeen disadvantageous to him. \n(b)A directs B to sell A ’s estate B, on looking over the est ate before selling it, finds a mine on the estate which is unknown \nto A. B informs A that he wishes to buy the estate for himself, but conceals the discovery of the mine. A allows B to buy, in \nignorance of the existence of the mine. A, on discovering that B knew of the mine at the time he bought the estate, may either \nrepudiate or adopt the sale at his option. \n216. Principal’s right to benefit gained by agent dealing on his own account in business of \nagency.—If an agent, without the knowledge of his principal, deals in the business of the agency on his \nown account instead of on account of his principal, the principal is entitled to claim from the agent any \nbenefit which may have resulted to him from the transaction. \nIllustration \nA directs B, his agent, to buy a certain house for him. B tells A it cannot be bought, and buys the house for himself. A may, \non discovering that B has bought the house, compel him to sell it to A at the price he gave for it. \n217.Agent’s right of retainer out of sums received on principal’s account.—An agent may retain, \nout of any sums received on account of the principal in the business of the agency, all moneys due to \nhimself in respect of advances made or expenses properly incurred by him in conducting such business , \nand also such remuneration as may be payable to him for acting as agent. \n218. Agent’s duty to p ay sums received for principal .—Subject to such deductions, the agent is \nbound to pay to his principal all sums received on his account. \n219.When agent’s remuneration becomes due .—In the absence of any special contract, payment \nfor the performance of any act is not due to the agent until the completion of such act; but an agent may \ndetain moneys received by him on account of goods sold, although the whole of the goods consigned to \nhim for sale may not have been sold, or although the sale may not be actually complete. \n220.Agent not entitled to remunerat ion for business misconducted .—An agent who is guilty of \nmisconduct in the business of the agency , is not entitled to any remuneration in respect of that part of the \nbusiness which he has misconducted. \nIllustrations \n(a) A employs B to recover, 1,00,000 rupees from C, and to lay it out on good security. B recovers the 1,00,000 rupees; and \nlays out 90,00 0 rupees on good security, but lays out 10,000 rupees on security which he ought to have known to be bad, \nwhereby A loses 2,000 rupees. B is entitled to remuneration for recovering the 1,00,000 rupees and for investing the 90,000 \nrupees. He is not entitled to any remuneration for investing the 10,000 rupees, and he must make good the 2,000 rupees to B. \n(b)A employs B to recover 1,000 rupees from C. Through B ’s misconduct the money is not recovered. B is entitled to no \nremuneration for his services, and must make good the loss. \n221. Agent’s lien on principal’s property.—In the absence of any contract to the contrary, an agent \nis entitled to retain goods, papers and other property , whether movable or immovable of the principal \nreceived by him, until the amount due to himself for c ommission, disbursements and services in respect \nof the same has been paid or accounted for to him. \n Principal’s duty to agent \n222.Agent to be indemnified agains t consequences of lawful acts .—The employer of an agent is \nbound to indemnify him against the consequences of all lawful acts done by such agent in exercise of th e \nauthority conferred upon him. \n \n49 \n \nIllustrations \n(a)B, at Singapur, under instructions from A of Calcutta, contracts with C to deliver certain goods to him. A does not send \nthe goods to B, and C sues B for breach of contract. B informs A of the suit, and A authorizes him to defend the suit. B defe nds \nthe suit, and is compelled to pay damages and costs, and incurs expenses. A is liable to B for such damages, costs and expenses. \n(b)B, a broker at Calcutta, by the orders of A, a merchant there, contracts with C for the purchase of 10 casks of oil for A. \nAfterwards A refuses to receive the oil, and C sues B. B informs A, who repudiates the contract altogether. B defends, but \nunsuccessfully, and has to pay damages and costs and incurs expenses. A is liable to B for such damages, costs and expenses. \n223.Agent to be indemnified against consequences of acts done in good faith.—Where one person \nemploys another to do an act, and the agent does the act in good faith, the employer is liable to indemnify \nthe agent against the consequences of that act, though it cause an injury to the rights of third persons. \nIllustrations \n(a)A, a dec ree-holder and entitled to execution of B ’s goods, requires the officer of the Court to seize certain goods, \nrepresenting them to be the goods of B. The officer seizes the goods, and is sued by C, the true owner of the goods. A is liable to \nindemnify the officer for the sum which he is compelled to pay to C, in consequence of obeying A’s directions. \n(b)B, at the request of A, sells goods in the possession of A, but whic h A had no right to dispose of, B does not know this, \nand hands over the proceeds of th e sale to A. Afterwards C, the true owner of the goods, sues B and recovers the value of the \ngoods and costs. A is liable to indemnify B for what he has been compelled to pay to C, and for B’s own expenses. \n224.Non-liability of employer of agent to do a cr iminal act.—Where one person employs another \nto do an act which is criminal, the employer is not liable to the agent, either upon an express or an implied \npromise, to indemnify him against the consequences of that Act1. \nIllustrations \n(a) A employs B to beat C, and agrees to indemnify him against all consequences of the act. B thereupon beats C, and has to \npay damages to C for so doing. A is not liable to indemnify B for those damages. \n(b)B, the proprietor of a newspaper, publishes, at A ’s request, a libe l upon C in the paper, and A agrees to indemnify B \nagainst the consequences of the publication, and all costs and damages of any action in respect thereof. B is sued by C and h as to \npay damages, and also incurs expenses. A is not liable to B upon the indemnity. \n225.Compensation to agent for injury caused by principal ’s neglect.—The principal must make \ncompensation to his agent in respect of injury 2caused to such agent by the principal ’s neglect or want of \nskill. \nIllustration \nA employs B as a bricklayer in building a house, and puts up the scaffolding himself. The scaffolding is unskilfully put up, \nand B is in consequence hurt. A must make compensation to B. \nEffect of agency on contracts with third persons \n226. Enforcement and consequences of agent ’s contracts.—Contracts entered into through an \nagent, and obligations arising from acts done by an agent, may be enforced in the same manner, and will \nhave the same legal consequences, as if the contracts had been entered into and the acts d one by the \nprincipal in person. \n Illustrations \n(a)A buys goods from B, knowing that he is an agent for their sale, but not knowing who is the principal. B ’s principal is the \nperson entitled to claim from A the price of the goods, and A cannot, in a suit by the principal, set-off against that clai m a debt \ndue to himself from B. \n \n \n1. See s. 24, supra. \n2. Cf. the Indian Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 (13 of 1855). \n50 \n \n(b)A, being B ’s agent , with authority to receive money on his behalf, receives from C a sum of money due to B. C is \ndischarged of his obligation to pay the sum in question to B. \n227. Principal how far bound, when agent exceeds authority.—When an agent does more than he \nis authorized to do, and when the part of what he does, which is within his authority, can be separated \nfrom the part which is beyond his authority, so much only of what he does as is within his authority is \nbinding as between him and his principal. \nIllustration \nA, being owner of a ship and cargo, authorizes B to procure an insurance for 4,000 rupees on the ship. B procures a policy \nfor 4,000 rupees on the ship, and another for the lik e sum on the cargo. A is bound to pay the premium for the policy on the ship, \nbut not the premium for the policy on the cargo. \n228.Principal not bound when excess of agent ’s authority is not separable .—Where an agent \ndoes more than he is authorized to do, and what he does beyond the scope of his authority cannot be \nseparated from what is within it, the principal is not bound to recognize the transaction. \n Illustration \nA authorizes B to buy 500 sheep for him. B buys 500 sheep and 200 lambs for one sum of 6, 000 rupees. A may repudiate \nthe whole transaction. \n229.Consequences of notice given to agent .—Any notice given to or information obtained by the \nagent, provided it be given or obtained in the course of the business transacted by him for the principal, \nshall, as between the principal and third parties, have the same legal consequences as if it had been given \nto or obtained by the principal. \n Illustrations \n(a)A is employed by B to buy from C certain goods, of which C is the apparent owner, and buys them accordingly. In the \ncourse of the treaty for the sale, A learns that the goods really belonged to D, but B is ignorant of that fact. B is not ent itled to \nset-off a debt owing to him from C against the price of the goods. \n(b)A is employed by B to buy from C goods of which C is the apparent owner. A was, before he was so employed, a servant \nof C, and then learnt that the goods really belonged to D, but B is ignorant of that fact. In spite of the knowledge of his agent, B \nmay set-off against the price of the goods a debt owing to him from C. \n230.Agent cannot personally enforce, nor be bound by, contracts on behalf of principal.—In the \nabsence of any contract to that effect, an agent cannot personally enforce contracts entered into by him on \nbehalf of his principal, nor is he personally bound by them. \nPresumption of contract to contrary —Such a contract shall be presumed t o exist in the following \ncases:— \n(1) where the contract is made by an agent for the sale or purchase of goods for a merchant \nresident abroad; \n(2) where the agent does not disclose the name of his principal; \n(3) where the principal, though disclosed, cannot be sued. \n231.Rights of parties to a contract made by agent not disclosed .—If an agent makes a contract \nwith a person who neither knows, nor has reason to suspect, that he is an agent, his principal may require \nthe performance of the contract ; but the other contracting party has, as against the principal, the same \nrights as he would have had as against the agent if the agent had been principal. \nIf the principal discloses himself before the contract is completed, the other contracting party may \nrefuse to fulfil the contract, if he can show th at, if he had known who was the principal in the contract, or \nif he had known that the agent was not a principal, he would not have entered into the contract. \n51 \n \n232. Performance of contract with a gent supposed to be principal .—Where one man makes a \ncontract with another, neither knowing nor having reasonable ground to suspect that the other is an agent, \nthe principal, if he requires the performance of the contract, can only obtain such performance subject to \nthe rights and obligations subsisting between the agent and the other party to the contract. \nIllustration \nA, who owes 500 rupees to B, sells 1,000 rupees worth of rice to B. A is acting as agent for C i n the transaction, but B has \nno knowledge nor reasonable ground of suspicion that such is the case. C cannot compel B to take the rice without allowing him \nto set-off A’s debt. \n233.Right of person dealin g with agent personally liable .—In cases where the agent is personally \nliable, a person dealing with him may hold either him or his principal, or both of them, liable. \nIllustration \nA enters into a contract with B to sell him 100 bales of cotton, and afterwards discovers that B was acting as agent for C. A \nmay sue either B or C, or both, for the price of the cotton. \n234. Consequence of inducing agent or principal to act on belief that principal or agent w ill be \nheld exclusively liable.—When a person who has made a contract with an agent induces the agent to act \nupon the belief that the principal only will be held liable, or induces the principal to act up on the belief \nthat the agent only will be held liable, he cannot afterwards hold liable the agent or principal respectively. \n235. Liability of pretended agent .—A person untruly representing himself to be the authorized \nagent of another, and thereby inducing a third person to deal with him as such agent, is liable, if his \nalleged employer does not ratify his acts, to make compensation to the other in respect of any loss or \ndamage which he has incurred by so dealing. \n236.Person falsely contracting as a gent not entitled to performance .—A person with whom a \ncontract has been entered into in the character of agent, is not entitled to require the performance of it, if \nhe was in reality acting, not as agent, but on his own account. \n237.Liability of principal inducing belief that agent ’s unauthoriz ed acts were authorized .—\nWhen an agent has, without authority, done acts or incurred obligations to third persons on behalf of his \nprincipal, the principal is bound by such acts or obligations, if he has by his words or conduct induced \nsuch third persons to believe that such acts and obligations were within the scope of the agent’s authority. \nIllustrations \n(a) A consig ns goods to B for sale, and gives him instructions not to sell under a fixed price. C, being ignorant of B ’s \ninstructions, enters into a contract with B to buy the goods at a price lower than the reserved price. A is bound by the contract. \n(b) A entrusts B with negotiable instruments endorsed in blank. B sells them to C in violation of private orders from A. The \nsale is good. \n238. Effect, on agreement, of misrepresentation of fraud, by agent .—Misrepresentation made, or \nfrauds committed, by agents acting in the course of their business for their principals, have the same \neffect on agreements made by such agents as if such misrepresentations or frauds had been made or \ncommitted by the principals; but misrepresentations made, or frauds committed, by agents, in matters \nwhich do not fall within their authority, do not affect their principals. \nIllustrations \n(a) A, being B’s agent for the sale of goods, induces C to buy them by a misrepresentation, which he was not authorized by \nB to make. The contract is voidable, as between B and C, at the option of C. \n(b) A, the captain of B ’s ship, signs bills of lading without having received on board the goods mentioned therein. The bills \nof lading are void as between B and the pretended cosignor. \n \n \n52 \n \nCHAPTER XI.—[OF PARTNERSHIP.]Rep. by the Indian Partnership Act , 1932 (9 of 1932), s. 73 \nand the Second Schedule. \n239.
