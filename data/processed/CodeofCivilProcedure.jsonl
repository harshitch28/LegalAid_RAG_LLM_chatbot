Particulars of set-off to be given in written st atement.— (1) Where in a suit for the recovery of \nmoney the defendant claims to set-off against the plaintiff's demand any ascertained sum of money legally \nrecoverable by him from the plaintiff, not exceeding the pecuniary limits of the jurisdiction of the Court, and \nboth parties fill the same character as they fill in the plaintiff's suit, the defendant may, at the first hearing of \nthe suit, but not afterwards unless permitted by th e Court, presents a written statement containing th e \nparticulars of the debt sought to be set-off. \n(2) Effect of set-off.— The written statement shall have the same effect as a plaint in a cross-suit so as \nto enable the court to pronounce a final judgment i n respect both of the original claim and of the set -off: \nbut this shall not affect the lien, upon the amount decreed, of any pleader in respect of the costs payable to \nhim under the decree. \n(3) The rules relating to a written statement by a defendant apply to a written statement in answer to a \nclaim of set-off. \nIllustrations \n(a) A bequeaths Rs. 2,000 to B and appoints C his exe cutor and residuary legatee. B dies and D takes out administration \nto B's effects, C pays Rs, 1,000 as surety for D; t hen D sues C for the legacy. C cannot set-off the d ebt of Rs. 1,000 \nagainst the legacy, for neither C nor D fills the s ame character with respect to the legacy as they fi ll with respect to \nthe payment of the Rs. 1,000. \n(b) A dies intestate and in debt to B. C takes out ad ministration to A’s effects and B buys part of the effects from C. \nIn a suit for the purchase-money by C against B, th e latter cannot set-off the debt against the price, for C fills \ntwo different characters, one as the vendor to B, i n which he sues B, and the other as representative to A. \n(c) A sues B on a bill of exchange. B alleges that A ha s wrongfully neglected to insure B's goods and is li able to him in \ncompensation which he claims to set-off. The amount not being ascertained cannot be set-off. \n(d) A sues B on a bill of exchange for Rs. 500. B holds a judgment against A for Rs. 1,000. The two claims being both definite \npecuniary demands may be set-off. \n \n1. Rule 5 renumbered as sub-rule (I) by Act 104 of 1976, s. 58 (w.e.f. 1-2-1977). \n2. Ins. by s. 58, ibid.

B hold a promissory note for Rs. 1,000 from A and cla ims to set-off that \namount against any sum that A may recover in the su it. B may do so, for, as soon as A recovers, both s ums are definite \npecuniary demands. \n(f) A and B sue C for Rs. 1,000. C cannot set-off a debt due to him by A alone. \n(g) A sues B and C for Rs. 1,000. B cannot set-off a debt due to him alone by A. \n(h) A owes the partnership firm of B and C Rs. 1,000. B d ies, leaving C surviving. A sues C for a debt for Rs. 1,500 due in his \nseparate character. C may set-off the debt of Rs. 1,000. \n1[6A .

Counter-claim to be stated.— Where any defendant seeks to rely upon any ground a s support-\ning a right of counter-claim, he shall, in his writ ten statement, state specifically that he does so b y way of \ncounter-claim. \n6C. Exclusion of counter-claim.— Where a defendant sets up a counter-claim and the plainti ff con-\ntends that the claim thereby raised ought not to be disposed of by way of counter-claim but in an indepen-\ndent suit, the plaintiff may, at any time before is sues are settled in relation to the counter-claim, apply to \nthe Court for an order that such counter-claim may be excluded, and the Court may, on the hearing of \nsuch application make such order as it thinks fit. \n6D.

Relief to defendant where counter-claim succeeds.— Where in any suit a set-off or counter-\nclaim is established as a defence against the plain tiff’s claim and any balance is found due to the \nplaintiff or the defendant, as the case may be. the Court may give judgment to the party entitled to \nsuch balance. \n6G . Rules relating to written statement to apply.— The rules relating to a written statement by a \ndefendant shall apply to a written statement filed in answer to a counter-claim.] \n7.
