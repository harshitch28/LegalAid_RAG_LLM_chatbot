When facts not otherwise relevant become releva nt. ––Facts not otherwise relevant are \nrelevant–– \n(1) if they are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact; \n(2) if by themselves or in connection with other facts they make the existence or non-existence of \nany fact in issue or relevant fact highly probable or improbable. \nIllustrations \n (a) The question is, whether A committed a crime at Calcutta on a certain day. \nThe fact that, on that day, A was at Lahore is relevant. \nThe fact that, near the time when the crime was com mitted, A was at a distance from the place where it was \ncommitted, which would render it highly improbable, though not impossible, that he committed it, is relevant. \n(b) The question is, whether A committed a crime. \nThe circumstances are such that the crime must have been committed either by A, B, C or D. Every fact which \nshows that the crime could have been committed by n o one else, and that it was not committed by either B, C or D, \nis relevant. \n12. In suits for damages, facts tending to enable C ourt to determine amount are relevant . –– In \nsuits in which damages are claimed, any fact which will enable the Court to determine the amount of \ndamages which ought to be awarded, is relevant. \n13.

Subs. by the A.O. 1950, for “Queen”. \n16 \nIllustrations \nThe question is, whether A has a right to a fishery. \nA deed conferring the fishery on A’s ancestors, a m ortgage of the fishery by A’s father, a subsequent grant of \nthe fishery by A’s father, irreconcilable with the mortgage, particular instances in which A’s father exercised the \nright, or in which the exercise of the right was stopped by A’s neighbours, are relevant facts. \n14. Facts showing existence of state of mind, or of body of bodily feeling. ––Facts showing the \nexistence of any state of mind such as intention, k nowledge, good faith, negligence, rashness, ill-wil l or \ngood-will towards any particular person, or showing the existence of any state of body or bodily feeli ng, \nare relevant, when the existence of any such state of mind or body or bodily feeling is in issue or relevant. \n1[Explanation 1.––A fact relevant as showing the existence of a r elevant state of mind must show that \nthe state of mind exists, not generally, but in reference to the particular matter in question. \nExplanation 2.––But where, upon the trial of a person accused of an offence, the previous \ncommission by the accused of an offence is relevant within the meaning of this section, the previous \nconviction of such person shall also be a relevant fact. 2] \nIllustrations \n(a) A is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing th em to be stolen. It is proved that he was in posses sion of a \nparticular stolen article. \nThe fact that, at the same time, he was in possessi on of many other stolen articles is relevant, as te nding to show \nthat he knew each and all of the articles of which he was in possession to be stolen. \n3[( b) A is accused of fraudulently delivering to anothe r person a counterfeit coin which, at the time when he \ndelivered it, he knew to be counterfeit. \nThe fact that, at the time of its delivery, A was p ossessed of a number of other pieces of counterfeit coin is \nrelevant. \nThe fact that A had been previously convicted of de livering to another person as genuine a counterfeit coin \nknowing it to be counterfeit is relevant.] \n(c) A sues B for damage done by a dog of B’s, which B knew to be ferocious. \nThe fact that the dog had previously bitten X, Y and Z, and that they had made complaints to B, are relevant. \n(d) The question is, whether A, the acceptor of a bil l of exchange, knew that the name of the payee was \nfictitious. \n The fact that A had accepted other bills drawn in the same manner before they could have been transmi tted to \nhim by the payee if the payee had been a real perso n, is relevant, as showing that A knew that the pay ee was a \nfictitious person. \n(e) A is accused of defaming B by publishing an imputation intended to harm the reputation of B. \nThe fact of previous publications by A respecting B , showing ill-will on the part of A towards B is re levant, as \nproving A’s intention to harm B’s reputation by the particular publication in question. \n \n1.

In \nexercising its discretion, the Court shall have regard to the following considerations:–– \n(1) such questions are proper if they are of such a nature that the truth of the imputation conveyed \nby them would seriously affect the opinion of the C ourt as to the credibility of the witness on the \nmatter to which he testifies; \n(2) such questions are improper if the imputation whi ch they convey relates to matters so remote \nin time, or of such a character, that the truth of the imputation would not affect, or would affect in a \nslight degree, the opinion of the Court as to the c redibility of the witness on the matter to which he \ntestifies; \n(3) such questions are improper if there is a great d isproportion between the importance of the \nimputation made against the witness’s character and the importance of his evidence; \n(4) the Court may, if it sees fit, draw, from the wit ness’s refusal to answer, the inference that the \nanswer if given would be unfavourable. \n149.

This is a \nreasonable ground for asking the witness whether he is a dakait. \n(b) A pleader is informed by a person in Court that a n important witness is a dakait. The informant, \non being questioned by the pleader, gives satisfact ory reasons for his statement.

Procedure of Court in case of question being a sked without reasonable grounds. –– If the \nCourt is of opinion that any such question was aske d without reasonable grounds, it may, if it was ask ed \nby any barrister, pleader, vakil or attorney, report the circumstances of the case to the High Court or other \nauthority to which such barrister, pleader, vakil or attorney is subject in the exercise of his profession. \n151.

Questions intended to insult or annoy. –– The Court shall forbid any question which appear s to \nit to be intended to insult or annoy, or which, tho ugh proper in itself, appears to the Court needless ly \noffensive in form. \n153. Exclusion of evidence to contradict answers to questions testing veracity. ––When a witness \nhas been asked and has answered any question which is relevant to the inquiry only in so far as it tends to \nshake his credit by injuring his character, no evid ence shall be given to contradict him; but, if he a nswers \nfalsely, he may after wards be charged with giving false evidence. \nException 1.–– If a witness is asked whether he has been prev iously convicted of any crime and \ndenies it, evidence may be given of his previous conviction. \nException 2.–– If a witness is asked any question tending to impeach his impartiality, and answers it \nby denying the facts suggested, he may be contradicted. \nIllustrations \n(a) A claim against an underwriter is resisted on the ground of fraud. \nThe claimant is asked whether, in a former transaction, he had not made a fraudulent claim.

He may be contradicted on the ground that the question tends to impeach his \nimpartiality. \n154. Question by party to his own witness. –– \n1[( 1)] The Court may, in its discretion, permit the \nperson who calls a witness to put any questions to him which might be put in cross-examination by the \nadverse party. \n2[( 2) Nothing in this section shall disentitle the pers on so permitted under sub-section ( 1), to rely on \nany part of the evidence of such witness.] \n155.

Questions tending to corroborate evidence of r elevant fact, admissible. –– When a witness \nwhom it is intended to corroborate gives evidence o f any relevant fact, he may be questioned as to any \nother circumstances which he observed at or near to the time or place at which such relevant fact \noccurred, if the Court is of opinion that such circumstances, if proved, would corroborate the testimony of \nthe witness as to the relevant fact which he testifies. \nIllustration \n A, an accomplice, gives an account of a robbery in which he took part. He describes various \nincidents unconnected with the robbery which occurr ed on his way to and from the place where it was \ncommitted. \nIndependent evidence of these facts may be given in order to corroborate his evidence as to the \nrobbery itself. \n157. Former statements of witness may be proved to corroborate later testimony as to same \nfact. –– In order to corroborate the testimony of a witn ess, any former statement made by such witness \nrelating to the same fact, at or about the time whe n the fact took place, or before any authority lega lly \ncompetent to investigate the fact, may be proved. \n \n \n1.

Refreshing memory. –– A witness may, while under examination, refresh his memory by \nreferring to any writing made by himself at the time of the transaction concerning which he is questioned, \nor so soon afterwards that the Court considers it l ikely that the transaction was at that time fresh i n his \nmemory. \nThe witness may also refer to any such writing made by any other person, and read by the witness \nwithin the time aforesaid, if when he read it he knew it to be correct. \nWhen witness may use copy of document to refresh me mory. –– Whenever a witness may refresh \nhis memory by reference to any document, he may, wi th the permission of the Court, refer to a copy of \nsuch document: \nProvided the Court be satisfied that there is suffi cient reason for the non-production of the original . \nAn expert may refresh his memory by reference to professional treatises. \n160. Testimony to facts stated in document mentioned in section 159. ––A witness may also testify \nto facts mentioned in any such document as is menti oned in section 159, although he has no specific \nrecollection of the facts themselves, if he is sure that the facts were correctly recorded in the document. \nIllustration \nA book-keeper may testify to facts recorded by him in books regularly kept in the course of business, \nif he knows that the books were correctly kept, alt hough he has forgotten the particular transactions \nentered. \n1161.

Giving, as evidence, of document called for an d produced on notice. ––When a party calls \nfor a document which he has given the other party n otice to produce, and such document is produced and \ninspected by the party calling for its production, he is bound to give it as evidence if the party producing it \nrequires him to do so. \n \n \n1.

Using, as evidence, of document production of which was refused on notice. –– When a party \nrefuses to produce a document which he has had noti ce to produce, he cannot afterwards use the \ndocument as evidence without the consent of the other party or the order of the Court. \nIllustration \nA sues B on an agreement and gives B notice to prod uce it. At the trial, A calls for the document and \nB refuses to produce it. A gives secondary evidence of its contents.
